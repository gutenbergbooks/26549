<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>WHICH SHALL IT BE?</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;And now that I have them, how am I
to decide? That is the question?&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker was a fine-looking man
about thirty-five years of age, seated before a
large writing-table in a handsomely appointed
library. It was littered with catalogues, pamphlets,
letters and papers sent from dozens of
schools, and from the quantity of them one
would fancy that every school in the country
was represented. This was the result of an advertisement
in the &#8220;Times&#8221; for a school in
which young children are received, carefully
trained, thoroughly taught, and which can furnish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
unquestionable references regarding its social
standing and other qualifications.</p>
<p>It was a handsome, but seriously perplexed,
face which bent over the letters, and more than
once the shapely hand was raised to the puckered
forehead and the fingers thrust impatiently
through the golden brown hair, setting it on end
and causing its owner to look more distracted
than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor, wee lassie, you little realize what a
problem you are to me. Would to God the one
best qualified to solve it could have been spared
to you,&#8221; and the handsome head fell forward
upon the hands, as tears of bitter anguish flooded
the brown eyes.</p>
<p>Can anything be more pathetic than a strong
man&#8217;s tears? And Clayton Reeve&#8217;s were wrung
from an almost despairing heart.</p>
<p>For ten years his life had been a dream of
happiness. At twenty-five he had married a
beautiful, talented girl, who made his home as
nearly perfect as a home can be made, and when,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
three years later, a little daughter, her mother&#8217;s
living image, came to live with them, he felt that
he had no more to ask for. Seven years slipped
away, as only years of perfect happiness can slip,
and then came the end. The beautiful wife and
mother went to sleep forever, leaving the dear
husband and lovely little daughter alone. For
six months Mr. Reeve strove to fill the mother&#8217;s
place, but until she was taken from him he had
never realized how perfectly and completely his
almost idolized wife had filled his home, conducting
all so quietly and gracefully that even
those nearest and dearest never suspected how
much thought she had given to their comfort
until her firm, yet gentle, rule was missed.</p>
<p>Happily, Toinette was too young to fully
appreciate her loss, and although she grieved in
her childish way for the sweet, smiling mother
who had so loved her, it was a child&#8217;s blessed
evanescent grief, which could find consolation
in her pets and dollies, and&mdash;blessed boon&mdash;forget.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>But Clayton Reeve never forgot, not for one
moment; and though the six months had in a
measure softened his grief, his sense of loss and
loneliness increased each day, until at last he
could no longer endure the sight of the home
which they together had planned and beautified.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither he nor his wife had
near relatives. She had been an only child
whose parents had died shortly after her marriage,
and such distant relatives as remained to
him were far away in England, his native land.
His greatest problem was the little daughter.
Nursemaids and nursery-governesses were to be
had by the score, but nursemaids and nursery-governesses
were one thing with a mistress at
the head of the household and quite another
without one, as, during the past six months, Mr.
Reeve had learned to his sorrow, and the poor
man had more than once been driven to the verge
of insanity by their want of thought, or even
worse.</p>
<p>At last he determined to close his house, place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
Toinette in some &#8220;ideal&#8221; school, and travel for
six months, or even longer, little dreaming that
the six months would lengthen into as many
years ere he again saw her. The trip begun for
diversion was soon merged into one for business
interests, as the prominent law firm of which he
was a member had matters of importance to be
looked after upon the other side of the water,
and were only too glad to have so efficient a
person to do it.</p>
<p>So, before he realized it, half the globe divided
him from the sunny-haired little daughter whom
he had placed in the supposed ideal school,
chosen after deliberate consideration from those
he had corresponded with.</p>
<p>But this anticipates a trifle.</p>
<p>As he sits in the library of his big house, a
house which seems so like some beautiful instrument
lacking the touch of the master hand to
draw forth its sweetest and best, the sound of
little dancing feet can be heard through the half-open
door, and a sweet little voice calls out:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Papa, Papa Clayton. Where is my precious
Daddy?&#8221; and a golden-haired child running
into the room throws herself into his arms, clasps
her own about his neck and nestles her head
upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>He held her close as he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, little Heart&#8217;s-Ease, what can the old
Daddy do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The child raised her head, and, looking at him
with her big brown eyes, eyes so like his own,
said, reproachfully: &#8220;You are <i>not</i> an old Daddy;
Stanton (the butler) is old, you are just my own,
own Papa Clayton, and mamma used to say that
you <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> grow old &#8217;cause she and I loved
you so hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Reeve quivered slightly at the child&#8217;s
words, and with a surprised look she asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you cold, dear Daddy? It isn&#8217;t cold
here, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not in the room, Heart&#8217;s-Ease, but right
here,&#8221; laying his hand upon his heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>The child regarded him questioningly with
her big, earnest eyes, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it grow cold because mamma went so
sound asleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so; but now let us talk about
something else: I&#8217;ve some news for you, but do
not know how you will like it; sit still while I
tell it to you,&#8221; and he began to unfold his plan
regarding the school.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>&#8220;A TOUCH CAN MAKE OR A TOUCH CAN MAR&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The school was chosen and Toinette placed
therein. What momentous results often
follow a simple act. When Clayton
Reeve placed his little girl with the Misses
Carter, intending to leave her there a few
months, and seek the change of scene so essential
to his health, he did not realize that her
whole future would be more or less influenced
by the period she was destined to spend there.
No brighter, sunnier, happier disposition could
have been met with than Toinette&#8217;s when she
entered the school; none more restless, distrustful
and dissatisfied than her&#8217;s when she left
it, nearly six years later.</p>
<p>If we are held accountable for sins of omission,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
as well as sins of commission, certainly the
Misses Carter had a long account to meet.</p>
<p>Like many others who had chosen that vocation,
they were utterly incapable of filling it
either to their own credit or the advantage of
those they taught. While perfectly capable of
imparting the knowledge they had obtained
from books, and of making any number of rules
to be followed as those of the &#8220;Medes and Persians,&#8221;
they did not, in the very remotest degree,
possess the insight into character, the sympathy
with their pupils so essential in true teachers.</p>
<p>It is not alone to learn that which is contained
between the covers of a book that our girls are
sent to school or college, but also to gather in
the thousand and one things untaught by either
books or words. These must be absorbed as the
flowers absorb the sunshine and dew, growing
lovelier, sweeter and more attractive each day
and never suspecting it.</p>
<p>And so the shaping of Toinette&#8217;s character, so
beautifully begun by the wise, gentle mother,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
passed into other and less sensitive hands. It
was like a delicate bit of pottery, the pride of
the potter&#8217;s heart, upon which he had spent uncountable
hours, and was fashioning so skilfully,
almost fearing to touch it lest he mar instead of
add to its beauty; dreading to let others approach
lest, lacking his own nice conceptions, they bring
about a result he had so earnestly sought to avoid,
and the vase lose its perfect symmetry. But,
alas! called from his work never to return, it is
completed by less skilful hands, a less delicate
conception, and, while the result is pleasing, the
perfect harmony of proportion is wanting, and
those who see it feel conscious of its incompleteness,
yet scarcely know why.</p>
<p>We will skip over those six miserable years,
so fraught with small trials, jealousies, deceptions
and an ever-increasing distrust, to a certain Saturday
morning in December.</p>
<p>The early winter had been an exceptionally
trying one, and Toinette, now nearly fourteen
years old, had seen and learned many things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
which can only be taught by experience. She
had seen that in some people&#8217;s eyes the possession
of money can atone for many shortcomings in
character, and that certain lines of conduct may
be condoned in a girl who has means, while they
are condemned in a girl who has not; that
she herself had many liberties and many favors
shown her which were denied some of her companions,
although those companions were quite
as well born and bred as herself, and with all the
latent nobility of her character did she scorn not
only the favors but those who showed them, and
often said to her roommate, Cicely Powell: &#8220;If
<i>I</i> chose to steal the very Bible out of chapel,
Miss Carter would only say, &#8216;Naughty Toinette,&#8217;
in that smirking way of hers, and then never do
a single thing; but if Barbara Ellsworth even
looks sideways she simply annihilates her. I
<i>hate</i> it, for it is only because Barbara is poor
and I&#8217;m&mdash;well, Miss Carter likes to have the
income I yield; I&#8217;m a profitable bit of &#8216;stock,&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
and must be well cared for,&#8221; and a burning flush
rose to the girl&#8217;s sensitive cheeks.</p>
<p>It was a bitter speech for one so young, and
argued an all too intimate acquaintance with
those who did not bear the mark patent of
&#8220;gentlewoman.&#8221;</p>
<p>The six years had wrought many changes in
the little child, both in mind and body, for, even
though one had been cramped, and lacked a
healthful development, the other had blossomed
into a very beautiful young girl, who would have
gladdened any parent&#8217;s heart. She was neither
tall nor short, but beautifully proportioned. Her
head, with its wealth of sunny, wavy hair, was
carried in the same stately manner which had
always been so marked a characteristic in her
father, and gave to her a rather dignified and
reserved air for her years. The big brown eyes
looked you squarely in the face, although latterly
they had a slightly distrustful expression.
Hurry home, Clayton Reeve, before it becomes
habitual. The nose was straight and sensitive,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
and the mouth the saving grace of the face, for
nothing could alter its soft, beautiful curves, and
the lips continued to smile as they had done in
early childhood, when there was cause for smiles
only. The mother&#8217;s finger seemed to rest there,
all invisible to others, and curve the corners upward,
as though in apology for the hardened
expression gradually creeping over the rest of
the face.</p>
<p>It is difficult to understand how a parent can
leave a child wholly to the care of strangers for
so long a period as Mr. Reeve left Toinette, but
one thing after another led him further and
further from home, first to Southern Europe,
then across the Mediterranean into wilder,
newer scenes, where nations were striving
mightily. Then, just as he began to think that
ere long his own land would welcome him, news
reached him of trouble in a land still nearer
the rising sun, and his firm needed their interests
in that far land carefully guarded. So thither
he journeyed. But at last all was adjusted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
and, with a heart beating high with hope, he
started for his own dear land and dearer
daughter.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that he had many conflicting
emotions as the great ship plowed its
way across the broad Pacific, and ample time in
which to indulge them. Many were the mental
pictures he drew of the girl there awaiting him,
and would have felt no little surprise, as well as
indignation, could he have known that she was
left in ignorance of the date of his arrival. But
Miss Carter had reasons of her own for concealing
it, and had merely told Toinette that her
father was contemplating a return to the States
during the coming year. It seemed rather a
cold message to the girl whose <i>all</i> he was, for
she had written to him repeatedly, and poured
out in her letters all the suppressed warmth of
her nature, yet never had his replies touched
upon the subject of her loneliness and intense
desire to see him, but had always assured her
that he was delighted to know that she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
happy and fond of her teachers. And Toinette
had not <i>quite</i> reached the age of wisdom which
caused her to suspect <i>why</i> he gave so little heed
to such information, although it would not have
required a much longer residence at the Misses
Carter&#8217;s to enlighten her. Happily, before the
revelation was made she was beyond further
chicanery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>&#8220;A FEELING OF SADNESS AND LONGING&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The half year was nearly ended, and most
of the girls were looking eagerly forward
to the Christmas vacation, which would
release them from a cordially detested surveillance.
But Toinette had no release to look forward
to; vacation or term time were much the
same to her. She had spent some of her holidays
with her schoolmates, but the greater part
of them had been passed in the school, and dull
enough they were, too.</p>
<p>The past week had been a particularly stormy
one, and the outcome had reflected anything but
credit upon the school. Consequently, the girls
were out of sorts and miserable, and the world
looked decidedly blue, with only a faint rosy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
tint far down in the horizon, where vacation
peeped.</p>
<p>As in most schools, Saturday was a holiday.
The day was wonderfully soft and mild for
December, and shortly after breakfast Toinette
threw her golf-cape about her shoulders and
stepped out upon the piazza to see if the fresh
air would blow away the mental vapors hovering
about her, for she felt not unlike a ship at sea
without a compass. Poor little lassie, although
what might be called a rich girl, in one respect
she was a very poor one indeed, for she had
scarcely known the influence of a happy home,
or the tender mother love which we all need,
whether we be big daughters or little ones.
True, she had never known what it meant to
want those things which girls often wish to have,
but which limited means place beyond their
reach. But often amidst the luxuries of her
surroundings, for her father provided most liberally
for her, she would be seized with a restless
longing for something, she hardly knew what,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
which made her feel out of sorts with herself
and everybody else.</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails you, this morning?&#8221; asked her
chum, Cicely Powell, joining her upon the
piazza. &#8220;You look as solemn as an oyster, and
I should think you&#8217;d feel jolly because it&#8217;s
Saturday, and that horrid Grace Thatcher won&#8217;t
be here to poke her inquisitive nose into all our
plans,&#8221; referring to the prime mischief-maker of
the school, already departed for her vacation,
with the admonition to think twice before returning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know <i>what&#8217;s</i> the matter with me:
I wish I did. Somehow, I don&#8217;t feel satisfied
with myself or anyone else, and I half believe I
<i>hate</i> everybody,&#8221; was Toinette&#8217;s petulant reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I like that, I declare!&#8221; was the sharp
retort. &#8220;Perhaps you include <i>me</i> among those
you hate, and if that is the case, Toinette Reeve,
you may just do as you like; I don&#8217;t care a
straw.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ordinarily Toinette&#8217;s reply would have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
as sharp as Cicely&#8217;s, but this time she just looked
at her with her big eyes&mdash;eyes suspiciously
bright, as though tears lay not far back of
them&mdash;and walked away, leaving Cicely to
wonder what had come over her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; was her rather vague comment.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what has come over Toinette
since that last flareup. Mercy knows, we&#8217;ve
had so many that we all ought to be used to
them by this time. She has acted as though
she were sorry that that horrid Grace was sent
off earlier than the others, and I&#8217;m sure she has
as much reason to be glad of it as any of us
have. She did nothing but tell tales about all
of us, and peep and spy upon her more than
anyone else. Miss Carter would never have
found out about half the things she did if it
hadn&#8217;t been for Grace, and we could have had
no end of fun,&#8221; and after this rather prolonged
monologue Cicely went to join the other girls.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Toinette had drawn the hood of
her cape over her head and strolled down to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
lower end of the garden, where a rustic summer-house
not far from the gate afforded a quiet little
nook in which to indulge one&#8217;s fancies, whether
pleasant or painful. Curling herself up in one
corner, she rested her cheek upon her arm, which
she had thrown over the railing, and looked
down the road toward the railway station.</p>
<p>Although a very beautiful one, it was a sad,
wistful young face which turned toward the sunshine
and shadows dancing upon the road.
Poor little Toinette, now is the moment in which
the mother-love you are unconsciously longing
for would make the world anew for you. If,
as you sit there, a gentle form and face could
creep up quietly, slip an arm about your waist
as she takes her seat beside you, and ask in the
tender tone that only mothers use: &#8220;Well,
Sweetheart, what is troubling you? Tell mother
all about it, and let us see if there is not a sunny
lining to the dark cloud that is casting its unpleasant
shadow over this cozy nook.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where is the daughter who could resist it?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
It would not be many minutes before the head
would find a happy resting-place upon the
shoulder beside it, and all the little trials and
troubles&mdash;trials so very real and very appalling
to young hearts&mdash;would be put into words, and
lose half their bitterness in the telling just because
love&mdash;that mighty magician&mdash;had come to
help bear them.</p>
<p>A great man once said: &#8220;O opportunity, thy
guilt is great!&#8221; and I have often wondered why
he did not add, &#8220;or thou art very precious.&#8221;
So much depends upon an auspicious moment.
A big door can swing upon a very small
hinge.</p>
<p>As Toinette looked down the road with unseeing
eyes, the whistle of an incoming train,
brought her back to a realization of things
around her. The station was barely half a mile
away, and ere ten minutes had passed a man
appeared in the distance. Evidently the owner
of that athletic figure knew where he was bound,
and was going to <i>get</i> there as quickly as his firm,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
long strides could carry him. He was a large
man, sun-burned to the point of duskiness,
bearded and moustached as though barbers were
unknown in the land from which he hailed.
Dressed in servicable tweed knickerbockers and
Norfolk jacket, his Alpine hat placed upon his
head to <i>stay put</i>, his grip slung by a strap across
his broad shoulders, he came striding over the
ground as though intent upon very important
business. Toinette watched his approach in a
listless sort of way, but as he drew nearer and
nearer seemed to recognize something familiar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can he be, and where have I seen him,
I wonder?&#8221; she said, half aloud, as she peered
at him from behind the lattice-work of the
summer-house.</p>
<p>On he came, quite unconscious of the big eyes
regarding him so intently, and presently stopped
to look about him, as though trying to recall old
landmarks. He now stood almost opposite
Toinette, when, chancing to glance toward the
house, he became aware of her presence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, little lady, you could have popped me
over from ambush if you had had a gun, for I
walked straight upon you and never suspected
that you were there. Can you direct me to the
Misses Carter&#8217;s school? The station-master said
it was about ten minutes&#8217; walk, but it is so many
years since I have been here that I find I&#8217;ve
forgotten the lay of the land, and I don&#8217;t want
to waste much time, for I&#8217;ve a very precious
somebody there whom I&#8217;m very anxious to see.
Last time I saw her she was only about knee-high
to a grasshopper, but I suspect I shall find
a young lady now, and have to be introduced to
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the sound of his voice Toinette arose to her
feet, her color coming and going, and her heart
beating so loudly that she was sure he could
hear it. As he finished speaking he regarded
with very genuine surprise the young girl who,
with parted lips and outstretched hands, was
walking toward him like one who doubted the
evidence of her own senses, and with a cry of,
&#8220;Papa! oh, papa! don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221; she
was gathered into the strong arms whose owner
had travelled half around the globe in order to
win that one precious moment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>NEW EXPERIENCES</h3>
</div>

<p>It did not take Clayton Reeve very long to
gain a pretty clear idea of the condition of
things at the Misses Carter&#8217;s school, or to
realize what influences had been brought to bear
upon his only daughter. To say that he was
keenly disappointed but mildly expresses it, and
he reproached himself bitterly for having left
her so long to the care of strangers. He remained
with Toinette until the school closed for
the holidays, and the time was the happiest she
had ever known. Nor was it for her alone, for
the other girls came in for their full share. He
was a very liberal man, and it gave him genuine
pleasure to make others happy.</p>
<p>The Misses Carter lost no opportunity of putting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
their establishment in a favorable light, for
they had a strong suspicion that they were in
a fair way to lose something of much more
tangible value to themselves: a very handsome
income. But Mr. Reeve easily saw through
their little foibles, and was not deceived by the
pretty veneer into believing that all was strong
and firm beneath.</p>
<p>He had traveled about the world too much
during the past six years not to have learned
something of human nature, and to read it pretty
correctly. Furthermore, his feeling of self-reproach
made him keenly alive to every change
upon Toinette&#8217;s speaking countenance, and when
he saw the look of questioning surprise which
came over it when one or the other of the Misses
Carter made some playful overture at petting
her, or one of the other girls, he drew his own
deductions.</p>
<p>When vacation arrived he settled his bill for
the year, bade them a courteous farewell, and,
with Toinette, &#8220;scraped the dust from his feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
and left the mansion.&#8221; Then came a two-weeks&#8217;
holiday such as she had never even dreamed of.
Mr. Reeve took rooms in one of New York&#8217;s finest
hotels, and gave himself up to the pleasure of
renewing his acquaintance with his daughter.
That holiday was never forgotten by either of
them, but for very different reasons.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove,&#8221; he said to himself more than once,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve let a good bit of precious time, and many
happy hours, slip away, if I&#8217;m not mistaken,
and I don&#8217;t know whether I shall ever catch
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>During their stay in the city Mr. Reeve went
in quest of his old college chum, Sydney Powell,
Cicely&#8217;s father, and had an interview with him
that was brief, but very much to the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Clint, old chap, and find what is
needed for the little girls, if you can. Cicely
will never go back to the Carter school, and I
should be glad to have the girls keep together.
They seem fond of each other. How would you
like to run out to Montcliff to look up that school?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
I&#8217;ve had fine reports of it from Fred Hubbard,
whose daughter is a pupil there?&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that directly after
vacation the two girls were escorted to Sunny
Bank, as the school was called, and, after a very
satisfactory talk with its sensible principal, Mr.
Reeve left them to her care, feeling sure that
this time he had not made any mistake.</p>
<p>Toinette and Cicely had adjoining rooms, and
nothing could have been daintier than the room
appointments. From their windows they could
look out over a wide sweep of the western valley,
where the sun was just sinking behind the hills,
and leaving upon the sky a glorious promise of
the day to follow.</p>
<p>They were still busy arranging their pretty
trifles about the rooms when the soft chime of
the Chinese gong in the wide hall below announced
dinner. Thus far they had not seen
any of the other girls, but as they stepped from
their rooms they were met by Miss Preston, who
said, as she slipped an arm about each waist:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do not forget how lonely <i>I</i> felt when I first
entered a strange school, so let me try to make
it easier for my new girls by introducing some
of my old ones; <i>real</i> old,&#8221; she added, laughingly,
as she called to two girls who were curled up on
one corner of the big divan at the lower end of
the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, chicks, and let me make you
acquainted with Miss Reeve and Miss Powell.
These are Miss Gordon and Miss Osgood, my
dears, but as we are all sort of &#8216;sisters, cousins
and aunts&#8217; in this big home, I&#8217;ll just hint right
off that their home names are Ruth and Edith,
who will be glad to welcome my Toinette and
Cicely.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time they had reached the cheerful
dining-room, and with a very significant exchange
of glances Toinette and Cicely took their
seats, the latter whispering under cover of the
bustle caused by the entrance of the other pupils:
&#8220;My goodness, if Miss Carter had ever spoken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
like that to us, we should have fallen flat,
shouldn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ruth sat upon one side, and Edith upon the
other, and it did not take the new girls long to
discover that the dinner hour must be one of the
pleasantest of the day, for all talked and chatted
in the liveliest manner, discussing various happenings,
and again and again appealing to Miss
Preston, who was not one whit behind in the
spirit of good-fellowship which prevailed.</p>
<p>There were six tables, each accommodating
ten people, and a teacher sat at the head of each.
In every instance a teacher who was wise enough
not to observe <i>too</i> much, but who in reality saw
everything, although she could laugh and joke
with the girls, put them at their ease, and at the
same time set them so perfect an example that
few girls would have cared to fail in following it.
Far from exercising a restraining influence, they
proved the jolliest of companions, as the repeated
appeals to their opinions, or the requests
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
for some anecdote or amusing story, evidently
old favorites, amply testified.</p>
<p>When the pleasant dinner was ended the girls
gathered in the big hall, where Toinette and
Cicely were introduced to many of the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have we to do now?&#8221; asked Toinette,
whose sharp eyes had been observing everything
worth observing, and whose active mind had received
more impressions within the past hour
than it had been called upon to receive in a
year. It is needless to add that she was quick
enough to profit by them, and to appreciate that
in <i>this</i> school were taught more surprising things
than chemistry or science.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do?&#8221; asked Ruth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; isn&#8217;t there some RULE to be observed
after dinner?&#8221; and a rather ironical tone came
into Toinette&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; come along, and Edith and I&#8217;ll show
you the rule, as you call it,&#8221; answered Ruth, as
she caught up the big basket-ball lying upon one
of the chairs in the hall, flew through the door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
with it, across the piazza and into the gymnasium
beyond.</p>
<p>After an instant&#8217;s hesitation the two girls followed,
joining her and Edith, who had run Ruth
a lively race.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say that the teachers let
you run and romp like this, do you?&#8221; demanded
Cicely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us!&#8221; cried Edith in surprise. &#8220;Why
shouldn&#8217;t they? We aren&#8217;t doing any harm,
are we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t suppose there is any harm, but
if we had done such a thing at Miss Carter&#8217;s,
what do you think would have happened, Toinette?&#8221;</p>
<p>Toinette pursed her mouth into the primmest
pucker, rolled her eyes in a horrified way,
clasped her hands before her, and said, in a
tragic tone: &#8220;Young <i>ladies!</i> Such conduct is
most <i>unseemly</i>,&#8221; in such perfect mimicry of Miss
Carter that Ruth and Edith shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, all I can say is, that I&#8217;m thankful <i>we</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
were not sent to that school; aren&#8217;t you, Ruth?&#8221;
said Edith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better believe I am,&#8221; was the feeling reply.
&#8220;I get skittish even in this blessed place sometimes,
but if I had been sent there I&#8217;d have
been just like one of those little red imps that
Miss Preston has standing on her writing table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;d have felt all rubbed the wrong
way, just as Cicely and I feel, and just hate the
sight of a teacher, and want to do everything
you could to plague them,&#8221; said Toinette, petulantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you won&#8217;t want to do that <i>here</i>&#8221; answered
Edith, emphatically. &#8220;If you cut any
such capers in <i>this</i> school, it won&#8217;t be the <i>teachers</i>
who will go for you, but the <i>girls</i>,&#8221; with a significant
wag of her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls?&#8221; asked Cicely, with a puzzled
expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain. We think our school about the
best going, and we aren&#8217;t going to let anyone
else think differently, if we can help it; are we,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
Ruth? So, if a girl takes it into her head to be
rude and cranky to the teachers, or other girls,
she finds herself in a corner pretty quick, I can
tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you break the rules?&#8221; asked Toinette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t any to break,&#8221; answered happy-go-lucky
Ruth, as she pranced down the big room
after the ball, which had gone bouncing off.</p>
<p>&#8220;No <i>rules!</i>&#8221; incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a single one. All you&#8217;ve got to do is to
be nice to everybody, remember you&#8217;re a gentlewoman
(or you wouldn&#8217;t be here, let me tell
you), and do your jolly best to pass your examinations.
If you don&#8217;t it is your own fault, and
you have to suffer for it; no one else, that&#8217;s
sure; for you can have all the help you ask for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toinette and Cicely exchanged glances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I daresay you don&#8217;t believe us,&#8221; said
Edith, who had correctly interpreted the glances,
&#8220;but just you wait and see. All the new girls
think the same, and I daresay that we should
have, too, if we had come here from some other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
school; but, thank goodness, we didn&#8217;t. There
aren&#8217;t any more schools like this, are there,
Ruth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nary one; there&#8217;s only one, and we&#8217;ve got
it,&#8221; cried the irrepressible Ruth, and two weeks
later the girls found that, truly, no rules could
be broken where none existed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION</h3>
</div>

<p>It could hardly be expected that, after her
training of the past six and a half years,
Toinette would at once respond to the
wiser, more elevating influences now surrounding
her. The old impulses would return, and
a desire to conceal where no concealment was
necessary often placed her in a false light.
She distrusted those in authority simply because
they were in authority, rather than that they
ever made it apparent. It seemed to have become
second nature with her, and bade fair to
prove a work of almost infinite patience and
love upon the part of the teachers to undo the
mischief wrought in those miserable years.</p>
<p>But, after making a toy of the poor child
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
for all that time, fickle fate seemed about to
make amends, and, although it was yet to be
proven, Toinette was now launched upon a sunny
sea, and destined to sail into a happy harbor.</p>
<p>She was sitting in her room one beautiful
afternoon about a week after her arrival at the
school, and, unconsciously doing profitable examples
in rhetoric by drawing nice contrasts
between her present surroundings and her
former ones. Presently a tap came upon her
door, and she called: &#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>In bounced Ruth, crying: &#8220;Come on down
to the village with us, will you? Edith and
Cicely are waiting at the gate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which teacher is going with us?&#8221; asked
Toinette, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teacher?&#8221; echoed Ruth. &#8220;Why, none, of
course. Why don&#8217;t you ask if we are going in a
baby-carriage?&#8221; and she laughed as she slipped
her arm through Toinette&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say that we will be allowed
to go by ourselves?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Toinette Reeve, I think you&#8217;ve got the
queerest ideas I ever heard of! Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of Ruth&#8217;s assurance, Toinette cast apprehensive
glances about her, as though she
expected a frowning face to appear around some
corner and rebuke them. Instead, however,
they came upon Miss Howard just at the end of
the corridor, who asked in a cheery voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where away so briskly, my lady birds?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to the village; good-bye,&#8221; answered
Ruth, waving her hand in farewell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pleasant journey. You will probably run
across Miss Preston down there somewhere, and
can act as bodyguard for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls walked briskly on, and presently
Cicely asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going for, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some good things, to be sure. I&#8217;m just
perishing for some cream-peppermints, and my
week&#8217;s pocket-money is scorching holes in my
pocket as fast as ever it can.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think Miss Preston would scold if
I got something, too?&#8221; asked Toinette.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would she scold about? You didn&#8217;t
<i>steal</i> the money you&#8217;re going to buy it with,
did you? And your stomach&#8217;s your own, isn&#8217;t
it? Besides, when you&#8217;ve been here a while
longer you&#8217;ll learn that Miss Preston <i>doesn&#8217;t</i>
scold. If she thinks a thing isn&#8217;t good for you
to do, she just asks you not to do it, and she
takes it for granted that you&#8217;ve got sense enough
to understand why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess you&#8217;re all <i>saints</i> in this school,&#8221;
replied Toinette, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as near as <i>I</i> can make out, you had a
pretty good supply of sinners where you came
from,&#8221; was the prompt retort.</p>
<p>When Ruth&#8217;s pocket was saved from destruction
the girls started homeward. They had not
gone far when three of the boys from the large
school at the upper end of the town were seen
coming toward them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, jolly,&#8221; cried Edith, &#8220;there are Ned,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
Allan and Gilbert! Now we&#8217;ll have fun; they&#8217;re
awfully nice. Allan has the dearest pony and
trap you ever saw, and is just as generous as can
be with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys were now beside them, and, raising
their caps politely, joined the party and were
introduced to the new girls. This was a complete
revelation to Cicely and Toinette, for at
Miss Carter&#8217;s school boys had been regarded as
a species of wild animal, to be shunned as though
they carried destruction to all whom they might
overtake.</p>
<p>But here were Ruth and Edith walking along
with three of those monsters in manly form,
and, still worse, talking to them in the frankest,
merriest manner, as though there were no such
thing on earth as schools and teachers. Toinette
and Cicely dropped a little behind, and soon
found an opportunity to draw Edith with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that Miss Howard said that
Miss Preston was down in the village. I&#8217;ll bet
a cookie there&#8217;ll be a fine rumpus if she catches
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
us gallivanting with all these boys,&#8221; whispered
Toinette.</p>
<p>A funny smile quivered about the corners of
Edith&#8217;s mouth, but before she could answer Miss
Preston herself stood before them. She had
suddenly turned in from a side street. As
though detected in some serious misdemeanor,
Toinette and Cicely hung back, and Edith remained
beside them.</p>
<p>With such a smile as only Miss Preston could
summon, she bowed to the group, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, little people? Are you
going to let me add one more to the party? I&#8217;m
not very big, you know, and I like a bodyguard.
Besides, I haven&#8217;t seen the boys in a &#8216;blue
moon,&#8217; and I think it high time I took them
to task, for they haven&#8217;t been to call upon us
in an age. Give an account of yourselves,
young sirs. Before very long there is going to
be a dance at a house I could mention, and you
don&#8217;t want to be forgotten by the hostess, do
you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>Toinette and Cicely found it difficult to believe
themselves awake. Touching Edith&#8217;s elbow,
they indicated by mysterious signs that
they wished to ask something, and dropped still
further behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it all mean, anyhow? She
doesn&#8217;t really mean to have the boys at the
house, does she?&#8221;</p>
<p>Edith&#8217;s eyes began to twinkle as though someone
had dropped a little diamond into each, and,
without answering, she gave a funny laugh and
took a few quick steps forward. Slipping an
arm about Miss Preston&#8217;s waist, she said: &#8220;Miss
Preston?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; turning a pleasant face toward
the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls are planning a candy frolic for
next Friday night, and were going to ask your
permission to-day, only they haven&#8217;t had time
yet. May we have it over in the kitchen of
the cottage, and may the boys come, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>A merry smile had overspread Miss Preston&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
face, and when Edith finished speaking, she
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Young gentlemen, I hope you didn&#8217;t hear
the last remark made by my friend, Miss Osgood;
at all events, you&#8217;re not supposed to have
done so; it would be embarrassing for us all.
But, since you did not, I&#8217;ll say to her: Yes,
you may have your candy frolic, and that is for
her ears alone. Now to you: The girls are to
have a candy frolic Friday evening, and would
be delighted to have your company.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had all been said in Miss Preston&#8217;s irresistibly
funny way, and was greeted with shouts
of laughter. Toinette and Cicely had learned
something new. All now crowded about her
urging her to accept some of their goodies, and,
joining heartily in the spirit of good-comradeship,
she took a sweetie from first one box and
then another. Possibly another person, with a
stricter regard for Mrs. Grundy&#8217;s extremely refined
sensibilities, might have hesitated to walk
along the highways surrounded by half a dozen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
boys and girls, all chattering as hard as their
tongues could wag, and munching cream-peppermints;
but Miss Preston&#8217;s motto was &#8220;Vis in
ute,&#8221; and, with the fine instinct so often wanting
in those who have young characters to form,
she looked upon the question from their side,
feeling sure that sooner or later would arise questions
which she would wish them to regard from
hers; and therein lay the key-note of her success.</p>
<p>She would no more have thought of raising
the barrier of teacher and pupil between herself
and her girls than she would have thought of
depriving them of something necessary to their
physical welfare. The girls were her friends
and she theirs&mdash;their best and truest, to whom
they might come with their joys or their sorrows,
sure of her sympathy with either, and,
rather than cast a shadow upon their confidence,
she would have toiled up the hill with the whole
school swarming about her, and an express-wagon
of sweets following close behind. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
was the secret of her wonderful power over
them. They never realized the disparity between
their own ages and hers, because she had
never forgotten when life was young.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>DULL AND PROSY</h3>
</div>

<p>It is to be hoped that those who read this
story will not run off with the idea that I
am trying to set Miss Preston&#8217;s school up
as a model in every sense of the word, for I am
not. I am simply trying to tell a story of boarding-school
life as it really was &#8220;once upon a
time.&#8221; And I think that I ought to be able to
tell it pretty correctly, having seen with my own
eyes and heard with my own ears many of the
pranks related. The methods followed and the
results obtained may be believed or not; that
rests with the individual reading. Long ago,
in my own childhood days, our &#8220;old Virginy&#8221;
cook used to say to me: &#8220;La, chile, dey&#8217;s a heap
sight mo&#8217; flies ketched wid &#8217;lasses dan vingegar,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
and I have come to the conclusion that she had
truth on her side.</p>
<p>The girls were by no means saints. Saints,
after all, are rather ethereal creatures, and Miss
Preston&#8217;s girls were real flesh and blood lassies,
brimful of life and fun, and, like most lassies,
ready for a good time.</p>
<p>As Ruth had said, there were no rules; that
is, the girls were never told that they must <i>not</i>
do this, or that they <i>must</i> do the other thing.
A spirit of courtesy dominated everything, and
a subtle influence pervaded the entire school,
bringing about desired results without words.
The girls understood that all possible liberty
would be granted them, and that their outgoings
and incomings would be exactly such as would
be allowed them in their own homes, and if
some were inclined to abuse that liberty they
soon learned where license began.</p>
<p>No school turned out better equipped girls, and
none held a higher standard in college examinations.
A Sunny Bank diploma was a sure passport.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
When the girls worked they worked hard,
and when playtime came it was enjoyed to the full.
Naturally, with so many dispositions surrounding
her, Miss Preston often in secret floundered
in a &#8220;slough of despond,&#8221; for that which could
influence one girl for her good might prove a
complete failure when brought to bear upon
another. Never was the old adage, &#8220;What is
one man&#8217;s meat is another man&#8217;s poison,&#8221; more
truly illustrated.</p>
<p>But Miss Preston had a stanch friend, and
trusted Him implicitly. Often, when perplexed
and troubled, a half-hour&#8217;s quiet talk with Him
close shut behind her own door would give her
wisdom and strength for the baffling question,
and when she again appeared among them the
girls wondered at her serene expression and
winning smile, for in that half-hour&#8217;s seclusion
she had managed to remove all trace of the soil
from the &#8220;slough,&#8221; and, refreshed and strengthened
by an unfailing help, could resume her
&#8220;Pilgrimage.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>She often said, in her quaint way: &#8220;The
hardest work I have to do is to undo,&#8221; and that
was very true. Many times the home influence
was of the worst possible sort for a young girl,
or else there was just none at all. Such girls
were difficult subjects. Many had come from
other schools, as in Toinette&#8217;s case, where distrust
seemed to be the key-note of the establishment,
and then came Miss Preston&#8217;s severest
trials. The confidence of such girls must be
won ere a step could be taken in the right
direction. It was a rare exception when Miss
Preston failed to win it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel such a nasty little bit of a crawling
thing when you&#8217;ve done a mean thing to Miss
Preston,&#8221; a girl once said. &#8220;If she&#8217;d only give
you a first-class blowing up&mdash;for that&#8217;s just what
you know you deserve all the time&mdash;you could
stand it, but she never does. She just puts her
arm around you and looks straight through you
with those soft gray eyes of hers, and never says
one word. Then you begin to shrivel up, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
you keep right on shriveling till you feel like
Alice in Wonderland. You can&#8217;t say boo, because
<i>she</i> hasn&#8217;t, and when she gives you a soft
little kiss on your forehead, and whispers so
gently: Don&#8217;t try to talk about it now, dear;
just go and lock yourself in your room and
have a quiet think, and I&#8217;m sure the kink will
straighten out. I could lie flat on the floor and
let her dance a hornpipe on me if she wanted to.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not to be expected that all the other
teachers would display such remarkable tact as
their principal, but her example went a long
way. Moreover, she was very careful in the
choice of those in whose care her girls were to
be given, and often said: &#8220;Neither schools nor
colleges make teachers: it is God first, and
mothers afterward.&#8221; And she was not far
wrong, for God must put love into the human
heart, and mothers must shape the character.
When I see a child playing with her dollies, I
can form a pretty shrewd guess of the manner of
woman that child&#8217;s mother is.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>Frolics and pranks of all sorts were by no
means unknown in the school, and often they
were funny enough, but what Miss Preston did
not know about those frolics was not worth
knowing. Her instructions to her teachers were:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t see <i>too much</i>. Unless there is danger of
flood or fire, appendicitis or pneumonia, be
blind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the girls had their own ponies and
carriages, and drove about the beautiful suburbs
of Montcliff. If the boys chose to hop up
behind a trap and drive along, too, where was
the harm? The very fact that it need not be
concealed made it a matter of course. Friday
evenings were always ones of exceptional liberty.
Callers of both sexes came, and the girls danced,
had candy pulls, or any sort of impromptu fun.
Once a year, usually in February, a dance was
given, which was, of course, <i>the</i> event of the
season.</p>
<p>During the week the girls kept early hours,
and at nine-thirty the house was, as a rule, en
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
route for the &#8220;Land o&#8217; Nod,&#8221; but exceptions
came to prove the rule, and nothing was more
liable to cause one than the arrival of a box
from home. Upon such occasions the &#8220;fire,
flood, appendicitis and pneumonia&#8221; hint held
good.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE P.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;L.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What upon earth are you doing!&#8221;
exclaimed Toinette, as she opened
Ruth&#8217;s door, in response to the
&#8220;come in&#8221; which followed her knock, and stood
transfixed upon the threshold at the spectacle
she beheld.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cleaning house, to be sure. Didn&#8217;t you
ever do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not exactly that way,&#8221; was Toinette&#8217;s
reply.</p>
<p>Ruth threw back her head and gave a merry
peal of laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> rather a novel way, I will admit, but,
you see, I hate to do things just exactly as everybody
else does, so I sailed right in, head over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
ears. To tell the truth, now I&#8217;m in, I wish it
wasn&#8217;t <i>quite</i> so deep,&#8221; and Ruth cast a look
strongly savoring of despair at the conglomeration
surrounding her.</p>
<p>She was seated in the middle of the floor, and
almost buried beneath the contents of every
drawer and closet in the room. Not only her
own, but Edith&#8217;s belongings, too, had been
dumped in a promiscuous heap on the floor, and
such a sea of underclothing, stockings, shoes,
dresses, waists, jackets, coats, hats, gloves, collars,
ties, ribbons, veils, dressing-sacques, golf-capes
and belts, to say nothing of the contents of both
their jewel boxes, no pen can describe.</p>
<p>Not content with the contents, the drawers,
too, had been dragged out to be dusted, and
were standing on end all about her, a veritable
rampart of defence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think you would know where to
begin,&#8221; said Toinette.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, and I think I&#8217;ll leave the whole
mess for Helma to tidy up in the morning,&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
up jumped Ruth, to give the last stroke to the
disorder by overturning the tray of pins and
hairpins which she had been sorting when
Toinette entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, now you have done it!&#8221; exclaimed
Edith, &#8220;and I can tell you one thing, you may
just as well make up your mind to put my
things back where you got them, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m not
going to,&#8221; and she wagged her head positively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me, this is what comes of trying to
be a P.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;L.,&#8221; said Ruth.</p>
<p>&#8220;A P.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;L.?&#8221; asked Toinette. &#8220;What in
the world is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>That&#8217;s</i> what it is! I found it stuck up in
my room when I got back from recitations to-day.
I&#8217;ve been in such a tear of a hurry for
the last few mornings that my room hasn&#8217;t been
quite up to the mark, I suppose, but Miss Preston
never said a word, and now here&#8217;s this thing
stuck here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toinette took the sheet of paper which Ruth
handed to her, and began to read:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>

<p>When she had finished reading, she sat down
on the edge of the bed and laughed till she
cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Ruth. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
way Miss Preston brings us up to schedule time.
When I came home from the school-building
this afternoon I thought I&#8217;d do wonders; and,&#8221;
she added, ruefully, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ve done them.
Good gracious, I&#8217;m so hungry from working
so hard that I just can&#8217;t see straight.
Isn&#8217;t there something eatable in the establishment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that much work reduces you to a state
of starvation, what will you be when it&#8217;s all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
done?&#8221; asked Edith. &#8220;There <i>were</i> some crackers
on the shelf, but land knows where they
are now; you&#8217;ve dragged every blessed thing
off of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are your crackers, right under your
nose,&#8221; said Ruth, triumphantly, as she pointed
to a box of wafers half hidden under Edith&#8217;s best
hat. &#8220;There&#8217;s some tea in that caddy, and you
can heat some water in the kettle. What more
do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>Edith scratched a match and held it to the
little alcohol lamp under the tea-kettle, but no
flame resulted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every bit of alcohol is burned out. Have
you any more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a drop; used the last to get the pine-gum
off my fingers after we came back from the
woods last Tuesday. Here, take the cologne,
that will do just as well,&#8221; and forthwith the
cologne was poured into the lamp, which was
soon burning away right merrily. The water was
heated, the tea made, and four girls sat down in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
the midst of the topsy-turvy room to sip tea and
munch saltines.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came in to ask,&#8221; said Toinette, &#8220;whether
you girls have any secret societies in this school;
have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nary one, as I know of,&#8221; answered the
irrepressible Ruth. &#8220;Wish we had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s start one,&#8221; said Toinette. &#8220;We had
two or three at Miss Carter&#8217;s; they had to be
secret or none at all, and it was no end of fun.
Papa wrote me that he was going to send me a
box of good things before long, and when it
comes let&#8217;s meet that night and have a feast.
He will no doubt send enough for the entire
school, he always does, and I want some of the
girls to have the benefit of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe you will have to urge them
very hard,&#8221; said Edith, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Ruth. &#8220;Which girls shall
we ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>Toinette named eight girls beside themselves,
saying:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That will make an even dozen to start with.
More may come later, but that is enough to
begin; don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty. If we have too many there will be
sure to be someone to let the cat out of the bag.
Come on, Cicely, let&#8217;s go hunt the others up,&#8221;
and, leaving Toinette and Edith in the orderly (?)
room, off they flew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>CAPS AND CAPERS</h3>
</div>

<p>The eight girls were quickly gathered in
Ruth&#8217;s and Edith&#8217;s room and listening
eagerly to the scheme afoot. It need not
be added that it was unanimously carried, and
it was only necessary to choose a name for the
society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all wear masks and caps and cut all
sorts of capers. It will be just no end of fun,&#8221;
cried Ethel Squire, a pretty, bright girl of fifteen
who was always ready for a frolic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221; cried Toinette, &#8220;and Ethel has
given me a fine idea for a name; let&#8217;s call it
the C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;C.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;C.? What under the sun does that
stand for?&#8221; asked Helen Burgess, a quiet, serene
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
little body, and a general favorite with the other
girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess,&#8221; said Toinette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cuffs and Collars Club,&#8221; said May Foster;
&#8220;mine cause me more trouble than all the rest
of my toilet, so they are never far from my
thoughts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cake and Cackle Club,&#8221; said another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheese and Cider; a delicious combination
when you&#8217;ve acquired a taste for them!&#8221; said
Marie Taylor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clandestine Carnivori,&#8221; was the last guess,
which raised a shout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious! let me tell you quickly before
you exhaust the dictionary,&#8221; laughed Toinette;
&#8220;how will the Caps and Capers Club do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Ruth, &#8220;just the very thing.
We&#8217;ll all wear our bath-robes and white caps
and masks. I&#8217;ve loads of white crepe paper,
which will be the very thing to make them of,
so let&#8217;s sit down and make them right away.
Come on, girls, help clear up this mess, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
then I&#8217;ll find the paper. I can give the finishing
touches to the closets and bureau drawers
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>All turned to with more ardor than skill, and
in a very few moments the conglomeration upon
the floor had vanished. How it fared with Ruth
and Edith when it came time to dress has never
been disclosed. However, the room restored to
outward order, twelve girls set to work to fashion
caps and masks, and, as the last one was completed,
the dressing-bell rang and all scattered
to prepare for dinner.</p>
<p>The evening hours at Sunny Bank were very
pleasant ones, for during the winter, while days
were short and nights were long, there was not
much opportunity for outdoor diversion. Immediately
after dinner Miss Howard, the literature
teacher, would place her snug little rocking-chair
before the cheerful open fire in the big
hall, and the girls would gather about her; some
on chairs, some on hassocks, and some curled
upon the large fur rug in front of the blazing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
logs, while she read aloud for an hour. A fine
library in Mont Cliff supplied books of every
imaginable sort, and the girls were allowed to
take turns in selecting them; providing, of course,
their selections were wise ones. But with Miss
Howard as guide they could not go far astray,
and many a delightful hour was passed before
the fire. Just at present the books chosen were
those relating to English history, and contained
good, hard facts, but, when the girls grew
a little tired of such substantial diet, historical
novels came handy for a relish. As England was
cutting a prominent figure in the world just
then, the girls were encouraged to keep in touch
with the current events, and to talk freely about
them. The last book read, at least the one they
were just concluding, was one which brought into
strong contrast the reigns of England&#8217;s two
greatest queens, and the subject was discussed in
a lively manner.</p>
<p>The book was finished shortly before the hour
ended, and, laying it upon her lap, Miss Howard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
began to ask a few leading questions in
order to get the girls started. As always happens,
there were some girls not wildly enthusiastic
over historical subjects, and such books
did not hold their attention as a modern novel
filled with thrilling situations would have done.
But these were the very ones whom Miss Howard
most wished to reach, and, feeling sure that
her chances of doing so through such methods
were far greater than could be hoped for if she
pinned them right down to hard, dry facts, she
took infinite pains to make her readings as interesting
as much research and a careful selection
of books could make them.</p>
<p>The conversation was in full swing, and Miss
Howard, in high feather over the very evident
impression the book had made, was congratulating
herself upon her choice of that particular
volume, when one girl asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Howard, what particular act of Elizabeth&#8217;s
reign do you think had the greatest influence
upon later reigns?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is rather a difficult question to answer,
Natala. It was such a brilliant reign and so
fraught with portentous results in the future
that it would be very difficult to say that this or
that one act was greatest of all; although, unquestionably,
the translation of the Bible was one
of the greatest blessings to posterity. Who can
tell me something of great interest which happened
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can!&#8221; cried Pauline Holden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more than delighted to hear it,&#8221; answered
Miss Howard, for Pauline was at once
her joy and her despair. Affectionate and
good-natured to the last degree, she was never
disturbed by anything, but I put it very mildly
when I say that Pauline did not possess a brilliant
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; continued Pauline. &#8220;There are not
many things in history that I care two straws
about, but I remembered that because the names
made me think of a rhyme my old nurse used
to say when she put me to bed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Howard&#8217;s hopes received a slight shock,
but she asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell us what it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was letting Matthew, Mark, Luke and
John out,&#8221; triumphantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Letting whom out?&#8221; asked Miss Howard,
wondering what upon earth was to follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, don&#8217;t you remember they let them out
during Elizabeth&#8217;s reign?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them out of <i>where</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, out of the Tower, to be sure, and it
made such a difference in a history some man
was writing just then, because they had had a
lot to do with it somehow&mdash;I don&#8217;t remember
just what it was. Maybe one of the other girls
can.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time all the other girls were nearly
dying of suppressed laughter, and when poor
Pauline turned to them so seriously it proved
the last straw, and such a shout as greeted her
fairly made the wall ring. It was too much for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
Miss Howard, and, with one last look of despair,
she gave way and laughed till she cried.</p>
<p>When the laugh had subsided and they had
recovered their breath, Miss Howard endeavored
to explain to the brilliant expounder of English
history that Queen Elizabeth had had more to
do with keeping Matthew, Mark, Luke and
John out of the Bible than <i>in</i> the Tower of
London.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A MODERN DIOGENES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Half-past nine. Sh! Yes, down in
the old laundry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole club. No end of fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>This whispered conversation took place in the
upper corridor. Many of the girls had come
from schools where frolics were looked upon as
an almost heinous crime, and strict rules and
surveillance had made their lives a burden to
them.</p>
<p>It was about ten o&#8217;clock when ghostly figures
began to slip through the dark halls. Lights
had been extinguished at nine-thirty and all was
now silent.</p>
<p>Miss Preston was in her room in a remote
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
part of the house, and most of the other teachers
had rooms in the adjoining building. The
laundry in this house was never used, and stout
blinds shut out&mdash;and in&mdash;all light.</p>
<p>Tap, tap, tap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; was whispered from within.</p>
<p>&#8220;C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;C., open for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door opened, and in skipped a figure
arrayed like the six already assembled, in a
warm dressing-gown and a high peaked paper
cap, with white tissue mask and spy-holes.</p>
<p>All spoke in whispers, so it was almost impossible
to recognize any one. But this only
added to the fun and mystery. &#8220;Spread the
feast, girls; the others will soon be here. Let&#8217;s
see, how many are there? Seven! Why don&#8217;t
the other five hurry? I wonder which ones
here aren&#8217;t here?&#8221; one girl laughingly whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll come, never fear, but their rooms
are nearer &#8216;headquarters,&#8217;&#8221; said another.</p>
<p>&#8220;What luck! Miss Preston doesn&#8217;t suspect a
thing. I met her in the hall just before &#8216;lights&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
bell, and she said as innocently as could be, &#8216;You
look as though you were quite ready for the
&#8220;land o&#8217; dreams,&#8221; Elsie, but so long as you do
not take a gallop on a &#8220;night mare&#8221; all will be
well,&#8217; and I could hardly help laughing when
I thought how soon I might be equipped for
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This fudge is my contribution,&#8221; said another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, girls! I&#8217;ve a brilliant idea,&#8221; said
Toinette. &#8220;Who&#8217;s got a long hairpin? Good!
that&#8217;s fine. Now prepare for something delectable,&#8221;
and, straightening out the pin, she stuck a
marsh mallow on it and held the white lump of
lusciousness over the one candle until it was
toasted a golden if rather smoky brown.</p>
<p>Tap, tap, tap.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the others. Quick! let them in, for
it&#8217;s half-past ten already.&#8221;</p>
<p>The signals were exchanged, and in walked
not five but nine more figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, girls, such luck! Just as I came out of
my room I ran right into Maud Hanscomb&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
arms, and she <i>wouldn&#8217;t</i> let me go till I&#8217;d told
her what was up and promised to let her and
the other girls share our fun. She said they
suspected something was up, and they were
bound to share it. And such a spread! Land
knows how they got it! Just look.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tubs were now groaning under their
burden of king apples, cookies, which bore a
striking resemblance to those served at dinner;
crackers, which had surely rested in the housekeeper&#8217;s
pantry, and, joy of joys, a huge tub of
ice cream, to say nothing of what the original
five brought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, girls, come on! Let&#8217;s eat our cream
and make sure of it in case of accidents,&#8221; said
the stout red ghost, in red cap and mask, who
presided over the tub. &#8220;No time to get plates,
so hand over anything you&#8217;ve got, and excuse the
elegance of my spoon. It&#8217;s cook&#8217;s soup spoon,
and may give the cream an oniony flavor, but
that will add to the novelty,&#8221; she said as she
served it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who is she, anyhow?&#8221; asked one girl, who
sat eating cream from a soap dish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t the least idea. One of the old girls,
I dare say, but who cares when she can conjure
up such delicacies?&#8221;</p>
<p>As midnight struck appetites and feast came
to an end.</p>
<p>&#8220;I vote,&#8221; whispered one girl, &#8220;that we all
take off our masks and have a good look at each
other, so we&#8217;ll know who&#8217;s who when we meet
in public.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a go,&#8221; whispered several others, and off
they all came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have more light,&#8221; said the donor of
the cream, and reached up and touched the
electric button.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Oh! Oh! Don&#8217;t! Miss Preston will
catch us!&#8221; cried dismayed voices, but Miss
Preston herself stood before them, a red mask
in one hand and a great spoon in the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t the first spread I&#8217;ve attended,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and I hope it won&#8217;t be the last. I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
had too good a time. I had an idea the old
laundry would prove an inviting place to-night,
but I never attend a feast without my tub and
candle&mdash;or electric light in this twentieth century&mdash;for,
like another mortal who had a fancy
for tubs and a candle, I am in search of honest
folk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your spread was a great success, girls. Only
next time let me know beforehand. I may not
be able to be present in person, but I can still
furnish the tub and light, and it will be a comfort
to me to know the menu in order to guard
against future ills. Good-night. I&#8217;m ready for
my bed, and I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if you were,
too,&#8221; and, with a flourish of her red cap and big
spoon, Miss Preston slipped through the door.</p>
<p>Some very wise ghosts sped away through
the dark corridors, and whispered conversations
were held far into the &#8220;wee, sma&#8217; hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day the story was all over the school,
and met with various comments. One of Miss
Preston&#8217;s combined torments and blessings was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
the teacher of chemistry, a thoroughly conscientious
woman, and exceptionally capable, but a
woman who took life very seriously. Miss
Preston used to say that Mrs. Stone must have
been forty years old when she was born, and consequently
had missed all her child and girlhood.
She was kind and just to the girls, but could not
for the life of her understand why they <i>must</i>
have fun, and that fun in secret was twice the
fun that everybody knew about.</p>
<p>Well Miss Preston knew that Mrs. Stone
would take advantage of her privilege as an old
friend, as well as one of the oldest teachers, and
come in her solemn way to discuss the latest
escapade, pro and con, so she was not in the
least surprised when there came a light tap upon
her door that afternoon, and Mrs. Stone entered.
&#8220;&#8216;Save me from my friends,&#8217;&#8221; quoted Miss
Preston, under her breath.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>&#8220;THEY COULD NEVER DECEIVE ME&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mrs. Stone, what can I do for you,
and why such a serious expression?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Marion,&#8221; said Mrs. Stone,
using Miss Preston&#8217;s Christian name, as she
sometimes did when more than usually solicitous
of her welfare, &#8220;I&#8217;ve come to have a little talk
with you regarding what happened last night,
and I&#8217;m sure you will not take it amiss from
one who has known you since your childhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I often take it amiss?&#8221; asked Miss
Preston, with an odd smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, no; you are most considerate of my
feelings, and I fully appreciate it, considering
our business relations. Of course, I have not
the slightest right to dictate to you, nor would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
I care to have you regard it in the light of dictation.
It is only my extreme interest in your
welfare that prompts me to speak at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And is my welfare in serious peril now?&#8221;
asked Miss Preston, half laughing as she recalled
the previous evening&#8217;s prank and her own
very thorough enjoyment of the fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my dear, not in peril, but I fear that
you will never grow to look upon your position
in the world with sufficient seriousness,
for, I assure you, your responsibility is enormous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I could forget that mighty fact for
one little fleeting moment,&#8221; thought Miss Preston,
but, aloud, she asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you think that I am not fully conscious
of it, Mrs. Stone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, most conscious! most conscious! You
could not be more conscientious, I am sure, but
you sometimes let a misdemeanor, such as occurred
last night, go unpunished, and it establishes
an unfortunate precedent, I fear.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever know me to punish any girl
placed in my charge?&#8221; asked Miss Preston, a
slight flush creeping over her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not! Certainly not!&#8221; cried Mrs.
Stone, hastily, for she had touched upon a point
which she knew to be a very sensitive one with
her principal, and wished to smooth matters
down a trifle. &#8220;I do not mean punishment in
the generally accepted term, but do you think it
wholly wise to let the girls feel that they can do
such things and, in a measure, find them
condoned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think that forbidding them would
put an end to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Merely forbidding might not do so, but exacting
some penalty for such disobedience would
probably make them think twice before they
disobeyed again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they disobey this time?&#8221; Miss Preston
asked quietly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stone looked a trifle disconcerted as she
answered:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly it was not direct disobedience, but
it certainly savored of deceit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be glad to have you ask any girl
who has become a member of that comical C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;if
she thinks she has been guilty of deceit,
and I&#8217;ll venture to say that she will look you
squarely in the eyes and say: &#8216;Deceit! How
could <i>that</i> fun be deceitful?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you not think that it may lead to other
undesirable lines of conduct?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may lead to other sorts of innocent fun,&#8221;
was the dry remark. &#8220;Mrs. Stone, were you
ever young? Surely, you have not forgotten
what the world looked like then. Wasn&#8217;t it
invariably the thing you were least expected to
do that it gave you the most satisfaction to do?
Listen to me one moment, for, while I appreciate
your sincere interest in my work and myself, I
cannot allow you to run off with the idea that
I regard my girls as prone to deceitful actions.
It is just fun, pure and simple, and the natural
result of happy, healthy girlhood. Far better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
let it have a safe vent than try to suppress it,
and take very strong chances of directing it into
less desirable channels. At the worst, a deranged
stomach can follow, and a glass of bi-carbonate
of soda-water is a simple remedy, if not an over-delightful
one. I knew all about the feast several
days ago, and took my own way of letting the
girls know that I&#8217;d found it out. It was no use
to forbid it for that night, for, just as sure as
fate, they would have planned it for another,
and devoured a lot of stuff far less wholesome
than the contents of Toinette&#8217;s box and my tub.
As it was, we all had a good time, and I&#8217;ll
warrant you that the next time the C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;C.&#8217;s
meet I&#8217;ll get a hint regarding the tub, at any rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it will prove so. I trust so, at all
events. You are a far wiser woman than I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps no wiser, but better able to recall
the things which helped to make my girlhood
a sunny one, and school frolics played no small
part in them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can but hope that the girls will refrain
from practicing deceit. Of course, they cannot
deceive <i>me</i>; no girl has ever yet succeeded in
doing so, although many have tried to. But I
can invariably detect the sham, and meet it successfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you may never find yourself undone,&#8221;
said Miss Preston, with a laugh. &#8220;Girls
are pretty quick-witted creatures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Girls are not blind to their elders&#8217; weaknesses
and pet delusions, and it was an understood
thing among them all that Mrs. Stone was
easily &#8220;taken in,&#8221; to use their own expression.
Consequently, they told her things, and laid
innocent little traps for her to walk into, such
as they would never have thought of doing for a
more wide-awake teacher, or, at least, one who
did not make such a strong point of her power
of discernment.</p>
<p>It was the very night after the Caps and
Capers escapade that the girls were gathered in the
upper hall talking about the previous night&#8217;s fun.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use talking; you <i>can&#8217;t</i> get ahead of
Miss Preston,&#8221; said one of the older girls. &#8220;You
may think you have, and feel aglow clear down
to the cockles of your heart, then&mdash;whew! in
she walks upon you as cool as&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ice cream!&#8221; burst in another girl. &#8220;To
my dying day, girls, I shall never forget that
red ghost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did she ever find it out, I&#8217;d like to
know,&#8221; asked Toinette. &#8220;Not a soul said a
word, and my box didn&#8217;t come till the very last
minute. I hardly had time to let the girls know,
and how Miss Preston ever got her tub of cream
in time is more than I can puzzle out. Maybe
Mrs. Stores had it on hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Stores! Yes, I guess so,&#8221; cried the
girls, scornfully. &#8220;You don&#8217;t for one moment
suppose that <i>she</i> would let us have a whole tub
of ice cream, do you? Not much,&#8221; said Lou
Perry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, if Miss Preston wanted it it would
be different, you see,&#8221; answered Toinette.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, it wouldn&#8217;t, either. Miss Preston never
bothers with the housekeeping or the housekeeper,
although she is always just as lovely
to her as she can be&mdash;she is to everybody, for
that matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For my part, I&#8217;m glad she found it out,&#8221;
laughed Cicely, &#8220;but if I&#8217;d suspected beforehand
that she would, wild horses wouldn&#8217;t have
dragged me into that laundry. It&#8217;s pretty
easy not to be afraid of such a teacher; she
seems just like one of us. Wasn&#8217;t she too funny
with that big spoon and the red mask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are all the other teachers so quick to &#8216;catch
on?&#8217;&#8221; asked Toinette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of them are sharp as two sticks,&#8221; replied
Ethel, &#8220;but they never let on. There is
only one who makes the boast that she has never
been deceived by any girl, and we&#8217;ve all been
just wild to play her some trick, only we&#8217;ve
never yet hit upon a really good one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to get Toinette to do the scene
from &#8216;Somnambula,&#8217;&#8221; said Cicely, laughing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? What is it? What is it?&#8221;
cried a half-dozen voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;The funniest thing you ever saw in all your
born days,&#8221; said Cicely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, tell us about it; please, do,&#8221; begged the
girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her do it for you; it will be ten times
funnier than telling it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When will you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night, if I can manage it; it will be a
good time after last night&#8217;s cut-up.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;LA SOMNAMBULA&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>When the bell for retiring rang at half-past
nine that night, it produced a
most remarkable effect, for, instead of
suggesting snug beds and dream-land, it seemed
instantly to banish any desire for sleep which
the previous study hour from eight to nine had
aroused in several of the girls.</p>
<p>They all went to their rooms, to be sure, but
once within them a startling change took place.
Instead of undressing like wise young people,
they slipped off their dresses, and put on their
night-dresses over the rest of their clothing, then
all crawled into bed to await the first act of
&#8220;La Somnambula.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had barely gotten settled when footsteps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
were heard coming softly down the corridor, as
though the feet taking the steps were encased
in wool slippers, and the owner of those feet
wished to avoid being heard. A few steps were
taken, then a pause made to listen, then on went
the cat-like tread from door to door.</p>
<p>Toinette&#8217;s and Cicely&#8217;s rooms communicated,
and just beyond, with another communicating
door, was the room occupied by Ruth and Edith,
but the door was always fastened. Perhaps
Miss Preston considered three communicating
rooms altogether too convivial, and decided that
&#8220;an ounce of prevention was always worth a
pound of cure.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the stealthy footfalls passed on down the
hall, a light tap fell upon Toinette&#8217;s door, and,
springing out of bed, she flew to give a corresponding
tap, and listen for what might follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh-h!&#8221; came in a whisper from the other
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the low reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear the &#8216;Princess&#8217; walk down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
hall?&#8221; The Princess was the big Maltese house
cat, and a privileged character.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty big <i>cat</i>,&#8221; was whispered back.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was Mother Stone, and she was just as
anxious to avoid being heard by Miss Preston
as she was anxious to hear what might be going
on in our rooms. If Miss Preston caught her
listening at anybody&#8217;s door, she would be angrier
than if we sat up all night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does she think we&#8217;re up to, anyway?&#8221;
whispered Toinette.</p>
<p>&#8220;No telling, but she knows we had a frolic
last night and is on the lookout for another
to-night, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she won&#8217;t look in vain,&#8221; laughed
Toinette, softly.</p>
<p>Twelve o&#8217;clock had just been struck by the
tall clock in the lower hall, when a white figure
walked slowly down the corridor. Her hair
fell in long, waving ringlets far below her waist,
her pretty white hands were outstretched in front
of her, and the great eyes, wide open, stared straight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
before her with a strange, unseeing stare. As
she walked along she whispered softly to herself,
but the words were hardly audible. On she
went, through the long corridor, down the little
side hall, which led to the pantry below, still
muttering in that uncanny manner.</p>
<p>It had long been a standing joke in the school
that Mrs. Stone slept like a cat, with one eye
open and one ear alert for every sound, for she
was continually hearing burglars, or marauders
of some sort or other. So it is not surprising
that before that ghost had gone very far another
white figure popped its head out into the hall
and uttered a smothered exclamation at sight of
number one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! dear me!&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;my
suspicions were not amiss. Poor, dear Marion, is
so very self-confident. I was sure the last night&#8217;s
folly would lead to something else. Such is
invariably the case,&#8221; and she followed rapidly
after the figure which was just vanishing around
the turn in the lower hall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Those children are certainly planning
another supper, and, what is far worse, are adding
to the discredit of such an act by resorting to
dishonest means of procuring the wherewithal
for it. Oh, it is shocking, shocking! And yet
Marion cannot be convinced that her girls are
capable of deceit. Poor child, poor child, it is
fortunate for her that there is someone at hand
to come to her rescue at such a crisis,&#8221; and Mrs.
Stone reached the bottom of the stairs just as the
evil-intentioned ghost slipped into the housekeeper&#8217;s
pantry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, I must be quite sure before I speak,
or I may bring about still greater trouble. But
what <i>can</i> she want here at this hour of the night
if it be not some of Mrs. Store&#8217;s provisions?&#8221;
and she wrung her hands in despair.</p>
<p>A dim light burned in the lower hall, rendering
everything there plainly visible from above;
and if Mrs. Stone had not been so distressed by
that which was before her, she might have been
aware of certain happenings just above her. Why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
did not some good fairy whisper in her ear just
at that moment: &#8220;An&#8217; had you one eye behind
you, you might see more detraction at your
heels than fortune before you,&#8221; but there were
apparently none out of Dream Land.</p>
<p>As her foot touched the lower step, five or six
heads peered over the banister railing above,
and what mystery of gravitation prevented as
many bodies from toppling over after them I
am unable to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do look! Do look! She is after her full
tilt, girls,&#8221; whispered Cicely. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell
you it would be the funniest thing you ever
saw?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh! She&#8217;ll hear us, and the whole thing will
be spoilt,&#8221; said Ethel.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed, she won&#8217;t,&#8221; answered Ruth,
&#8220;she is too intent upon catching Toinette.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, why <i>can&#8217;t</i> I stretch my neck out a yard
or two so that I may see what is going on in that
pantry? Come on girls, I&#8217;m going downstairs
if I die for it,&#8221; and down crept Lou, followed by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
all the others, for there was no lack of bedroom
slippers at Sunny Bank.</p>
<p>Meantime Toinette had entered the store-room,
and, going straight to the corner where some
smoked hams and bacon were hanging, took a
monstrous ham from its hook, then, muttering,
&#8220;Crackers, too, crackers, too,&#8221; opened the cracker
box and drew forth a handful.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stone was thoroughly scandalized, but,
just as she was about to speak, Toinette turned
full upon her and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will have some mustard, and a beefsteak,
and baked beans, please. Mrs. Stores
had some on the table to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time Mrs. Stone began to realize that
the girl was not accountable for her actions, for
never was there a better bit of acting for an
amateur. Yet she dared not wake her, for stories
of the serious harm which had befallen somnambulists,
when wakened suddenly in unfamiliar
surroundings, flashed through her brain, and
she was nearly beside herself with anxiety.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I do? what <i>shall</i> I do?&#8221; she
said aloud in great distress; and, as though in
answer to her question, Toinette answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Go, tell Mrs. Stone that she isn&#8217;t up to snuff
as much as she thinks she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was too much, and, laying her hand
gently on Toinette&#8217;s arm, she said, softly:</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear child, hadn&#8217;t you better come
back upstairs with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without changing her expression, Toinette
replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;How oats, peas, beans and barley grow,
nor you, nor I, nor Mrs. Stone knows,&#8221; and
began to dance around in a circle with her ham
tightly clasped in one arm, and the crackers
scattering from one end of the pantry to the other.</p>
<p>Now thoroughly alarmed, and almost in tears,
Mrs. Stone said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear, dear little girl, won&#8217;t you
come back to your room with me?&#8221; and, grasping
hold of Toinette&#8217;s arm, endeavored to lead
her from the pantry.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;GO, TELL MRS. STONE SHE ISN&#8217;T UP TO SNUFF.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>But my lady was having altogether too good
a time to end her frolic so soon, while the
audience upon the stairs were nearly dying from
their efforts not to scream. So, without changing
that dreadful stare which she had maintained
throughout her performance, she said, as though
repeating Mrs. Stone&#8217;s own words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back&mdash;come back&mdash;come back, my
Bonny, to me,&#8221; and turned to leave the pantry.
She had barely gotten outside the door, however,
when she paused, and, muttering something
about lemons and pickles, slipped away from
Mrs. Stone&#8217;s grasp and disappeared within the
pantry again.</p>
<p>Trembling with excitement, Mrs. Stone stood
for one instant, and then saying, &#8220;Miss Preston
must be called, Miss Preston must be called,&#8221;
turned and literally flew up the stairs, for once
too lost to everything but the matter in hand
to be aware of anything else, which was certainly
fortunate for the white-robed figures, which nearly
fell over each other in their scramble to escape.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;HAVE YOU NOT BEEN DECEIVED THIS TIME?&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>When Miss Preston arrived upon the
scene Toinette was serenely making
her way upstairs, her burdens still in
her arms, but supplemented by several lemons
and a bottle of pickles. She took no notice
whatever of the new arrival, but walked straight
to her own room, and, placing her treasures
upon her bed, covered them carefully with her
bedclothes. At this covert act poor Mrs. Stone
gasped despairingly, and, grasping Miss Preston&#8217;s
arm, said, in a most tragic whisper:
&#8220;Marion, Marion, what did I tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>But &#8220;Marion&#8221; was very much alive to the
situation, and, had not a slight quiver about
Toinette&#8217;s mouth while Mrs. Stone was speaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
confirmed her suspicions, some very audible
giggles from the rooms close at hand would have
done so.</p>
<p>Having tucked her ham snugly to bed, Toinette
proceeded to tuck herself there, and, with a
sigh as innocent as a tired infant&#8217;s, she closed
those staring eyes and slipped off to the land of
dreams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think the first act is ended,&#8221; said
Miss Preston, with the funniest of smiles, &#8220;and
we shall not have the second to-night, at any rate.
But this one was certainly performed by a star,&#8221;
and, stepping to Toinette&#8217;s bedside, she quietly
drew from beneath the covers the &#8220;dry stores&#8221;
there sequestered, placed them upon the table,
and then smoothed the clothes carefully about
her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stone began to gather up the articles Miss
Preston laid upon the table, and, consequently,
did not see her slyly pinch the rosy cheek resting
upon the pillow nor the flash of intelligence
which two big brown eyes sent back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>They then left Toinette to her slumbers (?),
and, after carrying the pilfered articles back to
the housekeeper&#8217;s pantry, returned to Miss Preston&#8217;s
room, where Mrs. Stone dropped into the
first chair that came handy. She was as near
a nervous collapse as she well could be, and
came very close to losing her temper when Miss
Preston seated herself upon her couch, clasped
her hands before her, and laughed as poor Mrs.
Stone had never known her to laugh before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Marion! Marion!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;<i>Have</i>
you taken leave of your senses?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was some seconds before Miss Preston
could control her voice enough to reply, and,
when she did, it proved the very last straw to
complete Mrs. Stone&#8217;s discomfiture, for her words
were:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mehitable Stone, had anyone told me that I
was sheltering beneath my roof-tree such a consummate
actress, I should have been the most surprised
woman in Montcliff. Upon my word
I never saw anything better done.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Acting!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Stone, aghast.
&#8220;You do not for one moment imagine that poor
child was acting? Impossible! Why, she was
as sound asleep as she ever was in all her life,
and there was not the least sign that she was conscious
of my touch when I took hold of her arm
to lead her from the pantry. Do you suppose
it would have been possible for her to dissemble
to that extent? <i>Never!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Preston did not answer, but laughed
softly again.</p>
<p>It was too much for Mrs. Stone; rising suddenly
to her feet, she said, with asperity: &#8220;It is
useless for us to discuss the matter further to-night,
nay, <i>this morning</i>,&#8221; looking at the tiny
clock ticking away upon Miss Preston&#8217;s desk,
&#8220;but I trust that in broad daylight you may see
more clearly. For my part, nothing will ever
convince me that that child was deceiving me;
my knowledge of girls is too perfect. It was a
most pronounced case of somnambulism, the outcome
of last night&#8217;s injudicious eating, and, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
my opinion, a very alarming condition, as one
can never tell to what it may lead. Her digestion
may be seriously impaired. It is quite unsafe
to leave her alone to-night, for she may be
seized with another attack at any moment. I
shall spend the remainder of the night upon the
couch in her room,&#8221; and away she went to take
up her sentinel duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quite unnecessary,&#8221; called Miss Preston
after the retreating figure, but no heed was
given to the words, and when Toinette waked in
the morning what was her surprise to find Mrs.
Stone bending over her asking, in the most solicitous
of voices, if she were feeling quite well.</p>
<p>For a moment Toinette was unable to take in
the situation, but her wits got into working order
pretty quickly, and only her quivering lips
would have betrayed her to a more discerning
person. Mrs. Stone, however, saw nothing but an
inclination to weep, and, stooping over Toinette,
said, soothingly: &#8220;There, there, dear, don&#8217;t hurry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
to rise, you are a little nervous this morning
and ought to rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Toinette was at the breakfast table as
promptly as anyone, and as she took her seat
she gave a quick glance toward Miss Preston;
but that astute woman was pouring cream into
her coffee-cup. An hour later, when all were
scurrying about getting ready for the walk to
the schoolhouse, which was situated several
blocks from the home house and its adjacent cottages,
Toinette came face to face with Miss Preston
in one of the upper halls. Both stopped
short, looked each other squarely in the eyes,
and said nothing. Then Miss Preston&#8217;s eyes
began to smile, and her mouth followed their example,
and, placing one finger under Toinette&#8217;s
chin, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am forced to admit that it was one of the
funniest things I&#8217;ve ever seen, and extremely
well done, but it scared Mrs. Stone nearly to
death; so, please, don&#8217;t favor us with the second
act.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>And that was the only allusion ever made by
Miss Preston to the midnight ramble, nor was
it ever repeated for Mrs. Stone&#8217;s benefit, although
nothing could ever have persuaded the
good lady that she had been the victim of a hoax
that night.</p>
<p>It would have been difficult to find a more
consummate teacher than Miss Preston, or one
who, without their ever suspecting it, could so
bring her girls up to the mark. It was a rare
exception when she failed to accomplish her aim,
and her tact was truly wonderful. There was
rarely a harsh word spoken, although Miss Preston
could speak sharply enough when occasion
required. But she seldom felt that it did. She
had most unique methods, and they proved wonderfully
successful. Then, too, some very old-fashioned
ideas were firmly imbedded in her mind,
which in the present day and age are often forgotten.
That bad spelling is a disgrace to any
girl was one of these, and most nobly did she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
labor to make such a disgrace impossible for any
of her girls.</p>
<p>Knowing how cordially human nature detests
doing the very thing best for it, she never had
regular spelling lessons in the school, but twice
a week every girl in it, big and little alike,
gathered in the large assembly room to choose
sides and spell each other down. So irresistibly
funny were these spelling matches, and so admirably
did they display Miss Preston&#8217;s peculiar
power over the girls, and their response to her
wonderful magnetism, that I think they deserve
a chapter to themselves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>ENGLISH AS SHE IS SPELLED</h3>
</div>

<p>The last half hour before recess on Wednesdays
and Fridays was the time set
aside for the spelling matches. On Wednesday
the words were chosen at random, sometimes
from history, sometimes from geography,
again from something which the classes had been
reading; but Friday&#8217;s words were invariably
a surprise.</p>
<p>One morning, immediately after the opening
exercises were concluded, Miss Preston rang her
bell, and, when the girls were all attention, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be well for those girls who are to
lead the opposing sides of the spelling match to-day
to choose with exceptional acumen&mdash;Annabel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
spell that word!&#8221; So suddenly had the
command been sprung upon her that, whatever
knowledge poor Annabel might have possessed
five seconds before, promptly flew straight out of
her head, and she answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ackumen.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry I haven&#8217;t time to pass it on just now,
but I&#8217;ll reserve that honor. As I was saying,
the heads had best keep their wits wide-awake,
for I&#8217;m going to choose the words from a highly
scientific and instructive volume to-day. It is
called &#8220;How to Feed Children,&#8221; and in this you
will observe that I have a double object in view:
to teach you which words, as well as the sort of
food, to be digested. Wholesome instruction,
my dears; and now to work, every woman Jill
of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>At ten-thirty all were again assembled in the
big room, and a lively choosing of sides ensued.
It was not by any means invariably the older
girls who could spell best, for often some of the
younger ones led them a fine race.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>Taking up the brilliantly bound little book,
Miss Preston said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my friends, I hope you will look upon
the cover of this book as a brilliant and rosy
example of what I expect, and, I beg of you, do
not disappoint me,&#8221; holding up the bright red
book for the inspection of all. &#8220;Do not become
excited, but learn to take a &#8216;philosophical&#8217; view
of it.&#8221; Miss Preston paused, and so well did
the girls understand her original way of doing
things that &#8220;philosophical&#8221; was at once essayed.
The first attempt resulted in &#8220;<i>philosopical</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little too suggestive of milk-toast, I&#8217;m
afraid, Marion. We must have our philosophy
upon a sound basis. Next.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several words passed successfully down the
line until &#8220;course&#8221; was given, and when that
was spelled &#8220;<i>cource</i>&#8221; Miss Preston&#8217;s face was a
study.</p>
<p>&#8220;That which we are most inclined to accept
as a matter <i>of course</i> we may be sure will prove
a matter of mortification to us. Katherine, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
are given to poetic flights. Who was it that said:
&#8216;The course of true love never did run smooth?&#8217;
He would have had an opportunity to learn that
there were also other courses which did not run
smoothly had he followed&mdash;&#8216;pedagogy.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>This proved a stumbling-block for the first
girl, but the next one spelled it correctly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Alma, that even the road thereto
has its pitfalls, so take warning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Catch me ever teaching,&#8221; was the half-audible
reply, but softly as it was spoken sharp
ears caught it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Posterity will be grateful for the blessings
in store for it, &#8216;undoubtedly.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The word fell to a little girl, but was rattled
off as quick as a wink, to Miss Preston&#8217;s great
amusement, for the child was an ambitious little
body who hated to be outdone by the big girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Desirability&#8221; was the next word, and was
given to one of the largest, although by no means
the most brilliant, girls in the school.</p>
<p>She hesitated a moment, and then said: &#8220;If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
desire is spelled d-e-s-i-r-e, I suppose the other
end of it will be a-b-i-l-i-t-y.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A quality in which you are lacking,&#8221; was
the instantaneous retort. &#8220;If you desired it
more, your ability would be greater.&#8221;</p>
<p>When desirability had been successfully dealt
with, ten or more words were happily disposed
of, then came another poser in the form of
&#8216;physiognomical,&#8217; and the groans which greeted
it foretold its fate.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it <i>mean</i>, anyway, Miss Preston?&#8221;
asked one girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there is more than one way of telling
you its meaning, but I believe in simple explanations,
so I will say, that when you all rush off
to the cloak-room at one o&#8217;clock that it would be
well for you to observe carefully the expression
upon the other girl&#8217;s face when you throw down
her hat and coat in your eagerness to get your
own first. You will then, doubtless, have an excellent
opportunity to form a correct idea of the
meaning of physiognomical. Then you may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
come and tell me whether you consider her
character an angelic or impish one.&#8221;</p>
<p>How well Miss Preston was aware of their
besetting sins, and how shrewdly did she use
them to their undoing.</p>
<p>I should never dare tell the wonderful combinations
of letters which were brought together
ere that dreadful word was spelled correctly; but
such a rapid sitting down followed that a stranger
coming suddenly upon them might have supposed
that Miss Preston&#8217;s girls were fainting one after
another.</p>
<p>About fifty words, all told, were spelled with
more or less success, and then came the grand
summing up, and those girls who could not yield
a clean record from beginning to end had to pay
the penalty.</p>
<p>Not a very severe one, to be sure, but one they
were not likely to forget, for each word that they
had misspelled was written upon a good-sized
piece of paper and pinned upon their breasts
&#8220;as a reward of demerit,&#8221; Miss Preston told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
them, and, although it was all done in fun and
joked and laughed over at the time, each girl
knew that those words must be thoroughly committed
to memory before the Wednesday spelling
match began its lively session, or her report at
the end of the term would be lacking in completeness.</p>
<p>And so, between &#8220;jest and earnest,&#8221; did Miss
Preston handle her girls, drawing by gentleness
from a sensitive nature, by firmness from a careless
one, by sarcasm (and woe to the girl who
provoked it, for it was, truly, &#8220;like a polished
razor keen&#8221;) from a flippant, and by one of her
rare, sweet smiles from the ambitious all that was
best to be drawn.</p>
<p>Toinette was naturally a remarkably bright
girl, and possessed qualities of mind which only
required gentle suggestions to develop their latent
powers. Refined and delicate by nature, keen
of comprehension, she slipped into her proper
niche directly way was made for her, and filled
it to her own credit and the satisfaction of others.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
Nor did it take Miss Preston long to discover
that a delicately strung instrument had been
placed in her hands, and that it must be touched
with skillful fingers if its best notes were to be
given forth.</p>
<p>The weeks slipped away, and winter, as though
to pay up for its tardy arrival, came in earnest,
bringing in February the heavy snowstorms
one looks for much earlier in the season in this
part of the globe. The girls hailed them with
wild demonstrations, for snow meant sleigh-rides,
and it is a frosty old codger who can frown and
grumble at the sound of sleigh-bells.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE BELLS&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>One morning early in February the girls
looked out of their windows to behold a
wonderful new world&mdash;a white one to
replace the dull gray one, which would have
made their spirits sympathetically gray, perhaps,
had they been older. But, happily, it
must be a very smoky gray indeed that can
depress fifteen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, Edith, come and look!&#8221; and then,
flying across the room, Ruth thumped upon
Toinette&#8217;s door, and called out: &#8220;Sleigh-bells!
Sleigh-bells! Don&#8217;t you hear them?&#8221;</p>
<p>The snow had fallen steadily all night, piling
up softly and silently the great white mounds,
covering up unsightly objects, laying the downiest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
of coverlids upon the dull old world until it
was hardly recognizable. Every ledge, every
branch and tiny twig held its feathery burden,
or shook it softly upon the white mass covering
the ground. Hardly a breath of air stirred, and
the fir trees looked as though St. Nick had
visited them in the night to dress a tree for every
little toddler in the land.</p>
<p>Down, down, down came the flakes, as though
they never meant to stop, and as one threw back
one&#8217;s head to look upward at the millions of tiny
feathers falling so gently, one seemed to float
upward upon fairy wings and sail away, away
into the realms of the Snow Maiden.</p>
<p>It was hard to keep one&#8217;s wits upon one&#8217;s work
that day, and many a stolen glance was given to
the fairy world beyond the windows of the recitation-rooms.
About five o&#8217;clock the weather
cleared, the sun setting in a glory of crimson and
purple clouds. An hour later up came my lady
moon, to smile approval upon the enchanting
scene and hint all sorts of possibilities.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>Lou Cornwall came flying into Toinette&#8217;s room
just after dinner to find it well filled with seven
or eight others.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come, too?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Oh, girls, if
we don&#8217;t have a sleigh-ride to-morrow, I&#8217;ll have
a conniption fit certain as the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you always have one when there is
snow?&#8221; asked Toinette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which, a sleigh-ride or a conniption fit?&#8221;
laughed Lou. &#8220;You&#8217;d better believe we have
sleigh-rides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better believe! I&#8217;ve been here five
years, and we&#8217;ve never missed one yet. Do you
remember the night last winter, when we all went
sleighing and came home at eleven o&#8217;clock nearly
frozen stiff, Bess? Whew! it was cold. When
we got back we found Miss Preston making
chocolate for us. There she was in her bedroom
robe and slippers. She had gotten out of bed to
do it because she found out at the last minute
that that fat old Mrs. Schmidt had gone poking
off to bed, and hadn&#8217;t left a single thing for us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I <i>do</i> remember, and didn&#8217;t it taste
good?&#8221; was the feeling answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t here the year before,&#8221; said
Lou. &#8220;Sit still, my heart! Shall I ever forget
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about it? Tell us!&#8221; cried the girls in
a chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the first year Mrs. Schmidt was
here, and, thank goodness, she isn&#8217;t here any
longer, and she hadn&#8217;t learned as much as she
learned afterwards. My goodness, wasn&#8217;t she
stingy? She thought one egg ought to be enough
for six girls, I believe. It took Miss Preston
about a year to get her to understand that we
were not to be kept on half rations. Well, that
night we were expecting something extra fine.
We got it!&#8221; and Lou stopped to laugh at the
recollection. &#8220;We rushed into the house, hungrier
than wolves, and ready to empty the pantry,
and what do you think we found? A lot of
<i>after-dinner coffee cups</i> of very weak cocoa, with
<i>nary</i> saucer to set them in, and two small crackers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
apiece. &#8216;I was thinking you would come in
hungry, young ladies, so I make you some chocolate.
You don&#8217;t mind that I have not some
saucers, it make so many dishes for washing,&#8217; she
said, smiling that pudgy smile of hers. Ugh!
I can&#8217;t bear to think of it even to this day, and
she was ten million times better before she left
last spring. That was the reason Miss Preston
took matters into her own hands the next time,
I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then a tap came at the door, and Miss
Preston put her head in to ask:</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you girls do extra hard work between
this and eight o&#8217;clock?&#8221;</p>
<p>Had she entertained any doubts of their ability
to individually do the work of three, the shout
which answered her in the affirmative would
have banished them forever, for the girls were
not slow to guess that some surprise was afoot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll trust you all to prepare tomorrow&#8217;s
lessons without exchanging an unnecessary
word, and at eight o&#8217;clock I&#8217;ll ring my bell,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
and then you must all put on extra warm wraps
and go out on the piazza to&mdash;look at the moon.
I shall not expect you to come in till ten-thirty.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the last word was uttered Miss Preston met
her doom, for five girls pounced upon her, bore
her to the couch and hugged her till she cried
for mercy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with us, oh! come with us,&#8221; they cried.
&#8220;It will be twice as nice if you&#8217;ll come!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come <i>where</i>? Do you suppose I&#8217;ve lived
all these years and never seen the <i>moon</i>?&#8221; and
laughing merrily she slipped away from them,
only pausing to add: &#8220;It is ten minutes of
seven now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hint was enough, and not a girl &#8220;got
left&#8221; that night.</p>
<p>At eight o&#8217;clock a silvery ting-a-ling was
heard, and never was bell more promptly responded
to. Had it been a fire alarm the rooms
could not have been more quickly emptied.</p>
<p>The moonlight made all outside nearly as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
bright as day, and when the girls went out upon
the porch they found three huge sleighs, with
four horses each, waiting to whirl them over the
shining roads for miles. Miss Preston did not
make one of the party, but Miss Howard was a
welcome substitute, for, next to Miss Preston, the
girls loved her better than any of the other
teachers, and Toinette was sorely divided in her
mind as to which she was learning to love the better.</p>
<p>Off they started, singing, laughing at nothing,
calling merrily to all they overtook, or passed,
and sending the school yell, which Miss Howard
had made up upon the spur of the moment for
them,</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Hoo-rah-ray! Hoo-rah-ray!</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 3.67em;'>U. S. A.,&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>out upon the frosty air, until the very hills rang
with the cry, and flung it back in merry echoes.</p>
<p>Miss Howard&#8217;s sleigh led the van, and one or
two of the girls had clambered up to ride upon
the high front seat with the driver, a sturdy old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
Irishman, who would have driven twenty horses
all night long to please any of Miss Preston&#8217;s
girls. Ruth sat beside him, with Toinette next to
her, and Edith was squeezed against the outer
edge. But who cares about being squeezed under
such circumstances? It&#8217;s more fun.</p>
<p>The snow had fallen so lightly that sometimes
the runners cut through slightly; but, all things
considered, the sleighing was very good. Still,
the driver kept the horses well in hand, for they
were good ones and ready to respond to a word.
Moreover, the hilarity behind them seemed to
have proved infectious, for every now and again
a leader or a wheeler would prance about as
though joining in the fun, and presently another
animal became infected and wanted to prance,
too. Had she not, the next chapter need not
have been written.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;PRIDE GOETH BEFORE A FALL&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>More than five miles had slipped away
under those swiftly-moving runners ere
Ruth was suddenly seized with a desire
to emulate a famous charioteer of olden time,
one &#8220;Phæton, of whom the histories have sung,
in every meter, and every tongue,&#8221; if a certain
poet may be relied upon. So, turning a beguiling
face toward the unsuspecting Michael beside
her, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fine driver, aren&#8217;t you, Michael?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;T is experience ivery man nades; I&#8217;ve had
me own,&#8221; observed Michael, complacently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be very hard to drive four horses at
once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anny one what kin droive two dacently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
should be able enough to handle four; &#8217;t is not
the number of horses, but the sinse at the other
ind av the reins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so? I thought it needed a strong
man to drive so many.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indade, no; it does not that. I&#8217;ve seen a
schmall, little man, hardly bigger than yerself,
takin&#8217; six along with the turn av his hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could he hold them if they started to go
fast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain as the woirld, he cud do that same.
&#8217;T was meself that taught him the thrick av it.
&#8217;T is easy larnt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then teach me right now, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor Michael, he saw when it was too late
that boasting is dangerous work, but to refuse
anything to &#8220;wan av the young ladies&#8221; never
for an instant occurred to him. Probably had
he asked Miss Howard&#8217;s consent he would have
been spared complying with a request which his
better judgment questioned, but that did not
occur to him, either, so, giving one apprehensive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
glance behind him at the twenty or more passengers
in the sleigh, he placed the reins in
Ruth&#8217;s hands, adjusting them in the most scientific
manner.</p>
<p>They were skimming along over a beautiful
bit of road with a thick fir wood upon one side
and open fields upon the other. The road was
level as a floor, and no turn would be made for
fully half a mile. Horses know so well the difference
between their own driver&#8217;s touch and a
stranger&#8217;s hand, and the four whose reins Ruth
now held were not dullards. They had been
going along at a steady round trot, with no
thought of making the pace a livelier one, but
directly the reins passed out of Michael&#8217;s hands
the spirit of mischief, ever uppermost in Ruth,
flew like an electric fluid straight through those
four reins, and, in less time than it takes to tell
about it, those horses had made up their minds to
add a little to the general hilarity behind them.</p>
<p>The change was scarcely perceptible at first,
but little by little they increased their pace, till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
they were fairly flying over the ground. Not
one whit did the girls in the sleigh object; the
faster the better for them. The sleighs behind
did their best to keep up, but no such horses
were in the livery stable as the four harnessed
to Michael&#8217;s sleigh, for Michael was the trusted
of the trusted.</p>
<p>But he was growing very uneasy, and, leaning
down close to Ruth, said: &#8220;Ye&#8217;d better be lettin&#8217;
me take thim now, Miss. We&#8217;ve the turn
to make jist beyant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, I can make it all right; you know you
said that anybody who drives two horses decently
could drive four just as well, and I&#8217;ve driven
papa&#8217;s always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yis, yis,&#8221; said Michael quickly, seeing when
too late that he had talked to his own undoing,
&#8220;but ye&#8217;d better be lettin&#8217; me handle thim be
moonlight; &#8217;t is deceptive, moonlight is,&#8221; and he
reached to take the reins from her. But alas!
empires may be lost by a second&#8217;s delay, and a
second was responsible for much now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>As Michael reached for the reins the turn was
reached also, and where is the livery stable
horse that does not know every turn toward
home even better than his driver, be the driver
the oldest in that section of the country! Around
whirled the leaders, and hard upon them came
the wheelers, and a-lack-a-day! hard, <i>very</i> hard,
upon a huge stone at the corner came the runner
of the front bob.</p>
<p>Had the whole sleighful been suddenly plunged
into a hundred cubic feet of hydrogen gas,
sound could not have ceased more abruptly for
one second, and then there arose to the thousands
of little laughing stars and their dignified
mother, the moon, a howl which made the welkin
ring.</p>
<p>Shall I attempt to describe what had happened
in the drawing of a breath? A bob runner
was hopelessly wrecked; two horses were sitting
upon their haunches, while two others were
striving to prove to those who were not too much
occupied with their own concerns to notice that,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
after all is said and done, the Lord <i>did</i> intend
that such animals should walk upon two legs if
they saw fit to do so. Michael stood up to his
middle in a snow-drift; Ruth sat as calmly upon
a snow bank as though she preferred it to any
other seat she had ever selected, albeit she was
well-nigh smothered by the back and cushions
of her novel resting-place; Toinette was dumped
heels-over-head into the body of the sleigh,
where she landed fairly and squarely in Miss
Howard&#8217;s lap; Edith hung on to the seat railing
for dear life, and screamed as though the lives of
all in the sleigh (or out of it) depended upon
her summons for assistance. The sleigh had not
upset, yet what kept it in a horizontal position
must forever remain a mystery, and such a heap
of scrambling, squirming, screaming girls as
were piled up five or six deep in the bottom of
it may never be seen again. Some had been
dumped overboard outright, and were floundering
about in the snow, which, happily, had saved
them from serious harm. With the inborn
chivalry of his race, Michael&#8217;s first thoughts
said: &#8220;Fly to the rescue of the demoiselles,&#8221; but
stern duty said: &#8220;Sthick to yer horses, Moik, or
they&#8217;ll smash things to smithereens, and, bedad,
I sthuck wid all me moight, or the Lord only
knows where we&#8217;d all have fetched up at that
same night,&#8221; he said, when relating his experiences
some hours later.</p>

<p>When excitement was at its height the other
sleighs arrived upon the scene, and if there had
been an uproar before, there was a mighty cry
abroad in the land now. But, dear me, it is all
in a lifetime; so why leave these floundering
mortals piled up in heaps any longer? They
were unsnarled eventually, gotten upon their
feet (or their neighbors&#8217;), packed like sardines
into the two other sleighs, and, with six instead
of four horses now drawing each, started homeward,
none the worse for their spill, excepting a
good shaking up, a few handfuls of snow merrily
forming rills and rivulets down their necks,
some badly battered hats and torn coats, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
one of them, at least, with some wholesome lessons
regarding handling four frisky horses when

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>LETTERS</h3>
</div>

<p>When the sleighing party reached home
they found hot chocolate and ginger
cookies awaiting them. Before retiring,
Miss Preston had seen to it that neither
shivering nor hungry bodies should be tucked
into bed that night.</p>
<p>Five weeks had now sped away, and Toinette
was beginning to look upon her new abiding-place
as home; at least, it was nearer to it than any she
could remember. The old life at the Carter
school seemed a sort of nightmare from which
she had wakened to find broad daylight and
all the miserable fancies dispelled.</p>
<p>She and Cicely were seated at their desks one
afternoon. It was half-past four and study hour.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
Cicely was hard at work upon her algebra lesson,
but Toinette was writing a letter. This,
she knew quite well, was not what she was supposed
to be doing, but the five weeks had not
sufficed to undo the mischief done in seven years,
and she was writing simply from a spirit of perversity.
There was ample time to do it during
her hours of freedom, but the very fact of doing
it when she knew full well that she ought to be
at work on her German added piquancy to the
act. Moreover, the letter was to a boy with
whom she had become acquainted while at Miss
Carter&#8217;s, and had kept the acquaintance a most
profound secret. Not that she cared specially
for the boy, although he was a jolly sort of chap,
and had been a pleasant companion during their
stolen interviews, and often smuggled boxes of
candy and other &#8220;forbidden fruit&#8221; into the girl&#8217;s
possession.</p>
<p>Still, at Miss Carter&#8217;s a boy sprouting angel&#8217;s
wings would have been regarded in very much
the same light as though he were sprouting imp&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
horns, and any girl caught talking to one&mdash;much
less corresponding&mdash;would have had a
very bad quarter of an hour, indeed. So, though
she did not care two straws whether she ever
saw him again or not, all the wrong-headedness
which had been so carefully fostered for the past
years delighted in the thought that she was
doing something which might not be approved;
indeed, from her standpoint, would be decidedly
criticised, and to get ahead of a teacher had been
the &#8220;slogan&#8221; of the Carter school.</p>
<p>It was the custom at Sunny Bank for the
teachers to go around to the girls&#8217; rooms during
the study hour to help, suggest, or give a little
&#8220;boost&#8221; over the hummocky places, so when a
pleasant voice asked at the door: &#8220;Can I help
you any, dearies?&#8221; Cicely answered from her
room:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Howard, will you please tell me
something about this problem? I am afraid my
head is muddled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure, I will,&#8221; was the cheery reply,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
and Miss Howard passed through Toinette&#8217;s room
to Cicely&#8217;s.</p>
<p>As she did so her dress created a current of
air which carried a paper from Toinette&#8217;s desk
almost to her feet. She stooped to pick it up
and hand it back to Toinette, who had sprung
up to catch it, and, as she handed it to her, Miss
Howard noted the telltale color spring into the
girl&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zephyrus is playing you tricks, dear,&#8221; she
said, smiling, and passed on to Cicely. After
giving her the needed assistance, she left them,
and a little further down the corridor met Miss
Preston.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are my chicks progressing, Miss
Howard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicely, Miss Preston. Cicely needed a little
help with a problem in algebra, but I think
Toinette needs a little of yours in the problem of
life,&#8221; and Miss Howard went her way.</p>
<p>A word to the wise is sufficient.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the letter was finished, addressed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
and slipped into Toinette&#8217;s pocket, to be mailed
later.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, all letters were placed in a small
basket to be carried to the office by the porter.
As Toinette came down the hall shortly before
dinner Miss Preston was just taking the letters
from the basket to place them in the porter&#8217;s
mailbag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any mail to go, dear?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Miss Preston,&#8221; answered
Toinette, and, jumping from the last step, ran
off down the hall to join Cicely and the other
girls. In jumping from the step something
jolted from her pocket, but, falling upon the
heavy rug at the foot of the stairs, made no
sound. As the porter was about to take the
pouch from her hands Miss Preston&#8217;s eyes fell
upon the letter, and, supposing it to be one which
had been dropped from the basket, stooped to
pick it up. She was a quick-witted woman, and
the instant she saw the handwriting and the address
she drew her own conclusions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So that is part of the life problem, is it?
Poor little girl, she has got to learn something
which the average girl has to unlearn; where
they entirely trust their fellow-beings, she entirely
distrusts them. I wonder if I shall ever
be able to show her the middle path?&#8221; Telling
the porter to wait a moment, Miss Preston slipped
into the library, and, catching up a pencil and
slip of paper, wrote down the name and address
which was written upon the envelope, then, stepping
back to the hall, handed the porter the
letter to post.</p>
<p>Toinette joined the girls, and in the lively
chatter which ensued forgot all about the letter
until several hours later, and then searched for
it in every possible and impossible place, but, of
course, without finding it, and was in a very <i>un</i>comfortable
frame of mind for several days, and
then something happened which did not serve to
reassure her, for a reply came to her from her
correspondent.</p>
<p>How in the world her letter had ever reached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
him was the question which puzzled her not a
little, and she fretted over the thing till she was
in a fever. Then she determined to write again
to ask how and when the letter had reached him,
although she was beginning to wish that boy,
letter and all, were at the bottom of the Red Sea,
so much had they tormented her. So a second
letter was written, and then came the puzzle of
getting it into the mail bag unnoticed. At Miss
Carter&#8217;s school all letters had been examined
before they were allowed to be mailed, and as
Toinette&#8217;s correspondence was supposed to be
limited to the letters she wrote to her father, she
had never inquired whether Miss Preston first
examined them or not, but, taking it for granted
that she did so, handed them to her unsealed.
On the other hand, Miss Preston, thinking
that it was simply carelessness that they were
not, usually sealed them and sent them upon
their way.</p>
<p>Although she had not said anything about it,
the little affair had by no means passed from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
Miss Preston&#8217;s thoughts, but she was trying to
think of the wisest way of going about it, and
was waiting for something to guide her.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can only win her confidence,&#8221; she said
to herself more than once.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;HAF ANYBODY SEEN MY UMBREL?&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the last week in February, and in a
few days the school dance was to be given.
One afternoon a dozen or more girls were
gathered in Ethel&#8217;s room to see her dress which
had been sent out from town. It was as dainty
an affair as one could wish to see, and many
were the admiring glances cast upon it, and many
the praises it received. Possibly it was a trifle
elaborate for a girl of fifteen, for it was made of
delicate white chiffon over pale yellow satin, and
exquisitely embroidered with fine silver threads.
But Ethel looked very lovely in it as she preened
herself before the mirror, and was fully aware
of the fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to wear, Toinette?&#8221; she
asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never worn anything but white yet,&#8221;
answered Toinette. &#8220;At Miss Carter&#8217;s all my
dresses were ordered by Miss Emeline, and she
said I ought not to wear anything else till I was
eighteen. I hope Miss Preston won&#8217;t say the
same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you would have hated to have
the teachers say just what you must wear, as well
as what you must study. Didn&#8217;t your father
ever send you any clothes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Papa was too far away to know what I wore
or did,&#8221; answered Toinette, rather sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you glad he is home again?&#8221; asked
quiet little Helen Burgess, who somehow always
managed to say soothing things when one felt
sort of ruffled up without knowing just why.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better believe I am!&#8221; was the emphatic
reply. &#8220;What will you wear, Helen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same thing I always wear, I guess.
I haven&#8217;t much choice in the matter, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toinette colored slightly at her thoughtless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
remark, for she had not paused to think before
speaking. All the girls knew that Helen&#8217;s purse
was a very slender one, and that it was only by
self-sacrifice and close economy that her parents
were able to keep her at such an expensive school.
She made no secret of her lack of money, but
worked away bravely and cheerfully, always
sunny, always happy, with the enviable faculty
of invariably saying the right thing at the right
time. She had pronounced artistic tendencies,
and Miss Preston was anxious to encourage them
in every possible way. Her great desire was
to go to Europe and there see the originals of
the famous paintings of which she read. Each
year Miss Preston went abroad and took with
her several of the girls whose parents could
afford such indulgences for them, and Helen
longed to be one of them, although she never for
a moment hoped to be.</p>
<p>She did really remarkable work for a girl of
her age, and was improving all the time, but the
trip over the sea seemed as far off as a trip to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
the moon. Toinette was somewhat of a dilettante,
and pottered away with her water-colors with
more or less success. But she admired good
work, and was quick to see that Helen was a
hard student, and to respect her for it. Although
so unlike in disposition, as well as position,
a warm regard had sprung up between
them, and Toinette spent many hours watching
Helen work away at her drawing. The girl&#8217;s
ambition was to illustrate, and there was hardly
a girl in the school who had not posed for her, and
the drawings in her sketch-book were excellent.</p>
<p>Toinette had never been taught to think much
about others, and so it is not surprising that,
while she admired Helen, and wished that she
could have those things she so longed for, it
never occurred to her that perhaps there were
other and more fortunate girls who might have
helped a trifle if they chose to do so. That
she, herself, had it within her power to do it
never entered her head till the girls began to
talk about their new dresses, and what put it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
there then would be hard to tell. Nevertheless,
come it did, and when she heard Helen speak so
composedly of wearing to the school dance, <i>the</i>
event of the season, in their eyes, the same dress
which had done service for many a little entertainment
given through the winter, and which
gave unmistakable signs of having done so, she
realized for the first time what it must mean to
be deprived of those things which she had always
accepted as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Still, no definite plans took shape in her head
regarding it, and it is quite possible that none
might ever have done so had not something occurred
within a short time which seemed to be
the hinge upon which her whole after-life swung.</p>
<p>As the girls were in the midst of their chatter
about the new gowns a tap came at the door, and
Fraulein Palme looked in to ask:</p>
<p>&#8220;Haf anyone seen my umbrel? I haf hunt
eferywhere for him, and can&#8217;t see him anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Fraulein, we haven&#8217;t seen it,&#8221; answered
several voices.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you last have it?&#8221; asked Ruth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right away in my room a little while before
I am ready to go out. I go down to the post-office
and must get wet without him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two or three of the girls went into the hall
to look for the missing umbrella, and others
went back to Fraulein&#8217;s room with her to make
a more exhaustive search. But without success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you more than one?&#8221; asked Edith.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is but one I haf got. It is very
funnee,&#8221; and poor Fraulein looked sorely perplexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take mine, Fraulein. Yours will turn up
when you least expect it,&#8221; said Toinette.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did it look like, Fraulein?&#8221; asked
Cicely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chust like thees,&#8221; was the astonishing answer,
as absent-minded Fraulein held forth the missing
umbrella, which all that time she had held tightly
clasped in her hand, and which had been the
cause of Edith&#8217;s question as to whether she had
more than one, for she supposed, of course, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
the one Fraulein was so tightly holding must
either be one she did not care to carry, or else
one she was about to return to someone from
whom she had probably borrowed it.</p>
<p>The shout which was raised at her reply
speedily brought poor Fraulein back to her
senses, and murmuring:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ach, so! I think I come <i>veruckt</i>,&#8221; she hurried
off down the hall with the girls&#8217; laughter
still ringing in her ears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE LITTLE HINGE</h3>
</div>

<p>The day before the dance was to be given
Toinette wrote her second letter, arguing
that when everybody else had so much
to occupy their thoughts they would have little
time to notice other people&#8217;s doings, and the
letter could be mailed without exciting comment.
Waiting until the very last moment, she
ran down to the mail-basket to slip the letter in
it unobserved. As ill-luck would have it, Miss
Preston also had a letter to be slipped in at the
last moment, and she and Toinette came face to
face. It was too late to retreat, for the letter
was in her hand in plain view, so, forced into
an awkward position, she made a bad matter
worse. Dropping the letter quickly into the
basket, she said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just a note for papa about something I want
for the dance to-morrow, Miss Preston; I didn&#8217;t
think you&#8217;d care, and I hadn&#8217;t time to do it
earlier,&#8221; and, with flaming cheeks, she turned to
go away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait just one moment, dear,&#8221; said Miss
Preston, &#8220;I&#8217;ve something to say to you. Walk
down to my room with me, please,&#8221; and she
slipped her arm about the girl&#8217;s waist.</p>
<p>No more was needed, and all the suspicion
and rebellion in Toinette&#8217;s nature rose up to do
battle with&mdash;windmills. It was a hard young
face that looked defiantly at Miss Preston.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toinette, dear, I want to have a little talk
with you,&#8221; she said, as she locked the door of
her sitting-room, and, seating herself upon the
divan, drew Toinette down beside her.</p>
<p>Toinette never changed her expression, but
looked straight before her with a most uncompromising
stare.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said just now that you did not think I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
would care if you sent a note to your father;
why should I, sweetheart?&#8221;</p>
<p>It must have been a stubborn heart, indeed,
which could resist Miss Preston&#8217;s sweet tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know, but teachers always seem
to mind every little thing one does,&#8221; replied
Toinette, sulkily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me that this would be entirely
too &#8216;little a thing&#8217; for a teacher or anyone else
to mind. Don&#8217;t you think so yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, I didn&#8217;t think you would
mind simply because I wrote to papa, but because
I posted the letter without first letting you
read it,&#8221; answered Toinette.</p>
<p>Now, indeed, was Miss Preston learning something
new, and not even a child could have
questioned that her surprise was genuine when
she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Read your letters, my dear little girl! What
are you saying?&#8221; and a slight flush overspread
her refined face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>It was now Toinette&#8217;s turn to be surprised as
she asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the rule here, Miss Preston?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it anywhere? I can hardly believe it.
One&#8217;s correspondence is a very sacred thing,
Toinette, and I would as soon be guilty of listening
at another person&#8217;s door as of reading a letter
intended for another&#8217;s eyes. Oh, my little girl,
what mischief has been at work here?&#8221;</p>
<p>While Miss Preston was speaking Toinette
had risen to her feet, her eyes shining like stars,
and her color coming and going rapidly. Now,
taking both Miss Preston&#8217;s hands in her own,
she said, in a voice which quivered with excitement:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that <i>truly</i> true, Miss Preston? Aren&#8217;t
the girls&#8217; letters ever read? Haven&#8217;t mine been?
<i>Do</i> you trust me like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Preston looked the girl fairly in the eyes
as she answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust you as I trust the others, because I feel
you to be a gentlewoman, and, as such, you would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
be as reluctant to do anything liable to cast discredit
upon yourself as I would be to have you.
I do not wish my girls to fear but to love me,
with all their hearts, and to trust me as I trust
them. I do not expect you to be perfect; we
all make mistakes; I make many, but we can
help each other, dear, and remember this: &#8216;Love
casteth out fear.&#8217; Try to love me, my little girl,
and to feel that I am your friend; I want so
much to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Preston&#8217;s voice was very sweet and appealing,
and as she spoke Toinette&#8217;s eyes grew
limpid. Miss Preston still held her hands, and,
as she finished speaking, the girl dropped upon
her knees and clasped her arms about her waist,
buried her face in her lap and burst into a storm
of sobs. All the pent-up feeling, the longing,
the struggle, the yearning for tenderness of the
past lonely years was finding an outlet in the
bitter, bitter sobs which shook her slight frame.</p>
<p>Although Miss Preston knew comparatively
little of the girl&#8217;s former life, she had learned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
enough from Mr. Reeve, and observed enough
in the girl herself, to understand that this outburst
was not wholly the result of what had just
passed between them. So, gently stroking the
pretty golden hair, she wisely waited for the
grief to spend itself before she resumed her talk,
and, when the poor little trembling figure was
more composed, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor little Toinette, let us begin a brand
new leaf to-day&mdash;&#8216;thee and me,&#8217; as the Quakers
so prettily put it. Let us try to believe that
even though I have spent thirty more years on
this big world than you have, that we can still
be good friends, and sympathize with each other
either in sunshine or shadow. To do this two
things are indispensible: confidence and love.
And we can never have the latter without first
winning the former. Remember this, dear, I
shall never doubt you. Whatever happens, you
may rest firm in the conviction that I shall always
accept your word when it is given. Our
self-respect suffers when we are doubted, and
one&#8217;s self-respect is a very precious thing, and
not to be lightly tampered with.&#8221;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>She now drew Toinette back to the couch beside
her, put her arm about her waist, and let
the tired head rest upon her shoulder. The girl
had ceased to sob, but looked worn and weary.
Miss Preston snuggled her close and waited for
her to speak, feeling sure that more was in her
heart, and that, in a nature such as she felt
Toinette&#8217;s to be, it would be impossible for her
to rest content until all doubts, all self-reproach
could be put behind her.</p>
<p>She sat perfectly still for a long time, her
hands clasped in her lap, and her big, brown
eyes, into which had crept a wonderfully soft
expression, looking far away beyond the walls of
Miss Preston&#8217;s sitting-room, far beyond the bedroom
next it, and off to some lonely, unsatisfied
years, when she had lived in a sort of truce with
all about her, never knowing just when hostilities
might be renewed. It had acted upon the
girl&#8217;s sensitive nature much as a chestnut-prickle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
acts upon the average mortal; a nasty, little, irritating
thing, hard to discover, a scrap of a thing
when found&mdash;if, indeed, it does not succeed in
eluding one altogether&mdash;and so insignificant that
one wonders how it could cause such discomfort.
But it is those miserable little chestnut-prickles
that are hardest to bear in this life, and so warp
one&#8217;s character that it is often unfitted to bear
the heavier burdens which must come into all
lives sooner or later.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;FATAL OR FATED ARE MOMENTS&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Nobody has ever spoken to me as you
have, Miss Preston,&#8221; Toinette began
presently, &#8220;and I can&#8217;t tell you how I
feel. Maybe heaven will be better, but I don&#8217;t
believe I shall ever feel any happier than I feel
this minute. It seems as though I&#8217;d been living
in a sort of prison, all shut up in the dark, and
that now I am out in the sunshine and as free as
the birds. But I must tell you something more: I
can&#8217;t rest content unless I do. The letter I posted
to-day wasn&#8217;t to papa, I sent it to Howard Elting,
in Branton, and it isn&#8217;t the first I&#8217;ve written him,
either. I didn&#8217;t lie about the other one, Miss
Preston; I was ready to mail it, but lost it; I
don&#8217;t know how. Somebody must have found it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
and posted it, for he got it and answered it, and
I was so puzzled over it that I wrote again.
That was the letter you saw me post. Now,
that is the truth, and I know that you believe
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toinette had spoken very rapidly, scarcely
pausing for breath, and when she finished gave
a relieved little sigh and looked Miss Preston
squarely in the eyes. Truly, her self-respect
was regained.</p>
<p>Will some of my readers say: &#8220;What a tempest
in a teapot?&#8221; To many this may seem a
very trivial affair, but how small a thing can influence
our lives! A breath, the passing of a
summer shower, may help or hinder plans which
alter our entire lives. And Miss Preston was
wise enough to understand it. Here was a
beautiful soul given for a time into her keeping.
Now, at the period of its keenest receptive powers,
a delicate and sensitive thing needing very gentle
handling.</p>
<p>Stroking the head again resting upon her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
shoulder, as though it had found a safe and happy
haven after having been tossed about upon a
troubled sea, she said, quietly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I posted the letter, dear; I found it in the
hall where it had been dropped; it never occurred
to me that there was any cause for concealment;
the girls all correspond with their
friends; it is an understood thing. I recognized
your writing, and, as I had friends at Branton,
I wrote to ask if they knew the person written
to. They replied that they did, and told me
who he was. Knowing how few friends you have,
I wrote to this boy asking him to come to our
dance to-morrow night, because I thought the
little surprise might give you pleasure, and you
would be glad to welcome an old friend. Does
it please you, my little girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Preston!&#8221; was all Toinette said,
but those three words meant a great deal.</p>
<p>The dressing-bell now rang, and Toinette
sprang up with rather a dismayed look. As
though she interpreted it, Miss Preston said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are in no condition to meet the other
girls to-night, dear. They cannot understand
your feelings, and, without meaning to be unkind
or curious, would ask questions which it
would embarrass you to answer. You are nervous
and unstrung, so lie down on my couch and
I will see that your dinner is brought up. I
shall say to the other girls that you are not feeling
well, and that it would be better not to disturb
you.&#8221; Then, going into her bedroom, Miss
Preston quickly made her own toilet. She had
just finished it when the chimes called all to dinner,
and, stooping over Toinette, she kissed her
softly and slipped from the room.</p>
<p>Some very serious thoughts passed through
Toinette&#8217;s head during the ensuing fifteen minutes,
and some resolutions were formed which
were held to as long as she lived.</p>
<p>A tap at the door, and a maid entered with a
dainty dinner. Placing a little stand close to
the couch, she put the tray upon it, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
asked: &#8220;Can I do anything more for you, Miss
Toinette?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Helma. This is very tempting.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Miss Preston came to her room an
hour later she found the tray quite empty, and
Toinette fast asleep. Arranging the couch pillows
more comfortably, and throwing a warm
puff over the sleeping girl, she whispered, softly:
&#8220;Poor little maid, your battle with Apollyon was
short and sharp, but, thank God, you&#8217;ve conquered,
even at the expense of an exhausted
mind and weary body.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight when Toinette opened
her eyes to see Miss Preston warmly wrapped
in her dressing-gown, and seated before the fire
reading. The lamp was carefully screened from
Toinette, who could not at first realize what had
happened, or why she was there, but Miss Preston&#8217;s
voice recalled her to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel rested, dear?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to go to your room; just undress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
and cuddle down in my bed with me to-night;
I&#8217;ve brought in your night-dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toinette did not answer, but, walking over to
Miss Preston, just rested her cheek against hers
for a moment. Twenty minutes later she was
fast asleep in her good friend&#8217;s bed.</p>
<p>The following day all was bustle and excitement
at Sunny Bank, for great preparations
were being made for the dance in the evening,
and understanding how much pleasure it gave
the girls to feel that they were of some assistance,
she let them fly about like so many grigs, helping
or hindering, as it happened.</p>
<p>They brought down all the pretty trifles from
their rooms, piled up sofa pillows till the couches
resembled a Turk&#8217;s palace; arranged the flowers,
and rearranged them, till poor Miss Preston began
to fear that there would be nothing left of
them. However, it was an exceedingly attractive
house which was thrown open to her guests
at eight o&#8217;clock that evening, and the girls had
had no small share in making it so.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>A very complete understanding seemed to
exist between Toinette and Miss Preston now,
for, although no words were spoken, none were
needed; just an exchange of glances told that
two hearts were very happy that night, for
love and confidence had come to dwell within
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;NOW TREAD WE A MEASURE.&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Shall we ever grow too old to recall the
pleasure of our school dances? Then
lights seem brighter, toilets more ravishing,
music sweeter, our partners more fascinating,
and the supper more tempting than ever
before or after.</p>
<p>The house was brilliantly lighted from top to
bottom, excepting in such cosy corners as were
specially conducive to confidential chats, and in
these softly shaded lamps cast a fairy-like light.</p>
<p>Miss Preston, dressed in black velvet, with
some rich old lace to enhance its charms, received
her guests in the great hall, some of the
older girls receiving with her.</p>
<p>There were ten or more girls who were taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
special courses, and these were styled &#8220;parlor
boarders,&#8221; and at the end of the school term
would enter society. Consequently, this dance
was looked upon as a preliminary step for the
one to follow, and the girls regarded it as a sort
of &#8220;golden mile-stone&#8221; in their lives, which
marked off the point at which &#8220;the brook and
river meet.&#8221;</p>
<p>A prettier, happier lot of girls could hardly
have been found, and none looked lovelier, or
happier, than Toinette. Her dress, a soft,
creamy white chiffon, admirably suited to her
golden coloring, had been sent to her by her
father, whose taste was unerring. No matter
how many miles of this big globe divided them,
he never forgot her needs, and, if unable to supply
them himself, took good care that some one
else should do so. So the dress had arrived the
night before, and Miss Preston had been able
to give her another pleasant surprise for the
dance. And now she looked as the lilies of the
field for fairness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>She was whirling away upon her partner&#8217;s
arm, when, chancing to glance toward the door,
she beheld something which brought her to an
abrupt stand-still, much to her partner&#8217;s amazement.
Miss Preston stood in the doorway, and,
standing beside her, with one hand resting lightly
upon his hip and the other raised a little above
his head, and resting against the door-casing,
stood a tall, remarkably handsome man. His
attitude was unstudied, but brought out to perfection
the fine lines of his figure.</p>
<p>Hastily exclaiming: &#8220;Oh, please, excuse me,
or else come with me,&#8221; Toinette glided between
the whirling figures, and, forgetful of all else,
cried out in a joyous voice: &#8220;Papa, papa Clayton,
where <i>did</i> you come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was so like the childish voice he had loved
to hear so long ago, that he started with pleasure.</p>
<p>During the brief holiday Toinette had spent
with him he had missed the spontaneity he had
known in the little child, and, without being
able to analyze it, felt that something was wanting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
in the girl. She had been sweet and winning,
yet under it all had been a manner quite incomprehensible
to him, as though she did not feel
quite sure of her position in his affections. Her
laugh had lacked the true girlish ring, and
her conversation with him seemed guarded, as
though she had never quite spoken all her
thoughts.</p>
<p>He had been immeasurably distressed by it,
for he could not understand the cause, and bitterly
reproached himself for not being better acquainted
with his own child. In the merry girl
who now stood before him, her eyes shining, her
cheeks flushed with excitement, her voice so
joyous, he saw no trace of the listless one he had
placed in Miss Preston&#8217;s charge two months before.</p>
<p>Slipping one arm about her, he snuggled her
close to his side, as he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;A blue-coated biped left a good, substantial
hint at my office not long since, and this is what
came of following it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> did it! I&#8217;m sure of it,&#8221; laughed Toinette,
shaking her finger at Miss Preston, as the
latter said: &#8220;I leave you to a livelier entertainer,
now, Mr. Reeve, while I go to look after some of
my guests who may not be so fortunately situated,&#8221;
and she slipped away, Toinette calling
after her: &#8220;You are responsible for most of the
nice things which happen here. Oh, daddy,&#8221;
dropping unconsciously into the old childish pet
name, &#8220;I&#8217;ve such stacks of things to tell you.
But, excuse me just one second, while I find a
partner for that boy I&#8217;ve left stranded high and
dry over there; doesn&#8217;t he look miserable?
Then I&#8217;ll come back,&#8221; and, kissing her hand
gaily, she ran off. Returning a moment or two
later, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There! he&#8217;s all fixed, and is sure to have a
good time with Ethel and Lou; they&#8217;re not a
team, but a four-in-hand. Now, come and have
a dance with me, and then we&#8217;ll go off all by
ourselves and have the cosiest time you ever
dreamed of. I feel so proud to have you all to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
myself,&#8221; she added, as they glided away to the
soft strains of the music, &#8220;so sort of grown-up
and grand with such a handsome partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear! hear! Do you want to make me
vain? I haven&#8217;t been accustomed to hearing
such barefaced compliments. They make me
blush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really believe they <i>do</i>,&#8221; answered Toinette,
throwing back her head to get a better look at
him, and laughing softly when she saw a slight
flush upon his face. &#8220;Never mind, it is all in
the family, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I have other reasons for feeling a
trifle elated,&#8221; he said, as the dance came to an
end and he followed Toinette to one of the cozy
corners. Springing up among the cushions, she
patted them invitingly, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, sit down here beside me, and let me
tell you all about the loveliest time of my life.
Oh, daddy, I <i>do</i> so love to be here, and you don&#8217;t
know how good Miss Preston is to me. She is
good to us all, but, somehow the other girls don&#8217;t
seem to need so much setting straight as <i>I</i> have.
I think I must have been all kinked up in little
hard knots before I came here, and Miss Preston
has begun to untie them. She hasn&#8217;t got all
untied yet, but I feel so sort of loosened up and
easy that everything seems lots more comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>Clayton Reeve did not smile at Toinette&#8217;s odd
way of explaining her feelings. He knew it to be
a fourteen-year-old girl who spoke, and that her
thoughts, to be natural, must be put into her own
words.</p>
<p>On she rambled, telling one thing after another,
and, while they were talking, Helen
Burgess stopped near their snuggery. It was
too dimly lighted for her to discover them, and
the next thing they knew they were unwitting
eavesdroppers, for Helen was talking very earnestly
to one of her boon companions, a day-pupil
at the school, and one of the brightest in it, but,
like Helen, not embarrassed with riches. For
some time the girls had been saving their small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
allowances toward the purchase of cameras, but
so slowly did the sums accumulate that it was
rather discouraging for them. They were now
talking about their respective ways of procuring
the sums of money needed, and the trifle they
had managed to save, and the small amounts
they earned in one way or another, to augment
the original sums, seemed so paltry to Toinette,
who never stopped to ask whence came the five-dollar
bills so regularly sent her each week, and
who, had a fancy entered her head for one,
would have walked out and bought a camera
very much as she would have bought a paper of
pins.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>CONSPIRATORS</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Reeve would have risen from his
snug corner and discovered himself to
the girls, but Toinette laid her finger
upon her lips to enjoin silence, and, although
he could not quite understand her desire to play
eavesdropper, he complied. From the subject of
the cameras the girls went on to Helen&#8217;s work
in the art class, for Jean was much interested in
that also, and they often built air-castles about
the wonderful things they would do when that
fabulous &#8220;stone ship&#8221; should sail safely into
port. They talked earnestly for girls of thirteen
and fifteen, and Mr. Reeve could not fail to be
impressed by the strength of purpose they seemed
to possess, and, having a good bit of stick-to-ativeness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
himself, admired it in others. Moreover,
he had been forced to make his own way
in life when young, and could sympathize with
other aspiring souls.</p>
<p>Presently the two girls moved away, and then
Toinette whispered: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you
think of me for making you play &#8216;Paul Pry,&#8217;
but I had a reason for it, and now I&#8217;ll tell you
what it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I inferred as much, so kept mum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, since I&#8217;ve been here I&#8217;ve
waked up a little, and, somehow, have begun to
think about other people, and wonder if they
were happy. At Miss Carter&#8217;s school everybody
just seemed to think about themselves, or, if
they thought of anybody else, it was generally
to wonder how they could get ahead of them
in some way. But here it is all so different,
and everybody seems to try to find out what
they can do to make someone else happy. I
can&#8217;t begin to tell you how it is done, because I
don&#8217;t know myself; only it <i>is</i>, and it makes you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
feel sort of happy all over,&#8221; said Toinette, trying
to put into words that subtle something which
makes us feel at peace with all mankind, and
little realizing that its cause lay right within herself;
for a sense of having done one&#8217;s very best
and a clear conscience are wonderful rosy spectacles
through which to see life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, I&#8217;m keenly interested, and these
little confidences are very delightful,&#8221; said her
father, with an encouraging nod and smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I began to want to do little things, too,
and, do you know, daddy, you&#8217;d be really surprised
if you knew what a lot of ways there are
of making the girls happy if you only take the
trouble to look for them. For instance, there is
Helen Burgess, the larger of the girls you saw
just now: we have become real good friends, and
she is very clever, and draws beautifully. But
she has so little to do with that she can&#8217;t afford
to get the things the other girls have to work
with, nor have the advantages they have. She
and Jean have been trying ever so long to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
cameras, for they think that they could take
pretty views of Montcliff and sell them to the
people who come here in the summer, and I&#8217;m
sure they could, too. It does not make so much
difference to Jean, for, although she isn&#8217;t rich,
she isn&#8217;t exactly poor, either, you know, and
has a good many nice things, but Helen never
seems to have any. So I thought I&#8217;d have a
little talk with you and get you to send out a
cute little camera for each of them and never
let them know where they came from. Wouldn&#8217;t
that be great fun? But I want to pay for them.
You can use ten dollars of my money, and not
send me my allowance for two weeks; I&#8217;ve got
enough to last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what will my poverty-stricken lassie do
meantime?&#8221; asked Mr. Reeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she is not so poverty-stricken as you
think,&#8221; laughed Toinette. &#8220;She won&#8217;t suffer. And
then I wanted to ask you if there wasn&#8217;t some
way of helping Helen in her art work. She
wants so much to go abroad with Miss Preston, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
has no more idea of ever being able to do so than
she has of going to the moon. What would it
cost, papa? Isn&#8217;t there some way of bringing
it about? Couldn&#8217;t you have a talk with Miss
Preston and find out all about it, and then we
could plan something, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toinette had become very earnest as she talked,
and was now leaning toward her father, her
hands clasped in her lap, and her expressive face
alive with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Mr. Reeve hated to spoil the pretty picture,
but said, in the interested tone so comforting
when used by older people in speaking to young
folk: &#8220;I am sure we can evolve some plan. I
shall be very glad to speak to Miss Preston before
I return to the city, and haven&#8217;t the
slightest doubt that great things will come of
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How lovely! You&#8217;re just a darling! I&#8217;m
going to hug you right here behind the curtains!&#8221;
cried Toinette, as she sprung up and
clasped her arms about his neck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you one or two more favors you&#8217;d
like to ask?&#8221; said Mr. Reeve, suggestively.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not another one, just now,&#8221; she answered,
laughing softly. &#8220;Too many might turn your
head, and mine, too. But it is so good to have
you home once more. You don&#8217;t know how
lonely I&#8217;ve been without you, daddy. There
wasn&#8217;t anyone in the world who cared two straws
for me till you came back and I came here.
But I&#8217;ve got you now, and I&#8217;m not going to let
you go very soon again, I can tell you. You are
too precious, and we are going to have lovely
times together by-and-by when I grow up, aren&#8217;t
we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not going to wait till then, sweetheart;
we are going to begin right off, this very
minute. I can&#8217;t afford to waste any more precious
time; too much has been wasted already,&#8221;
he said, as he raised the pretty face and kissed
it, and then, drawing her arm through his,
added: &#8220;Now let me do the honors. Introduce
me to your friends, and let me see if seven years&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
knocking about this old world has made me forget
the &#8216;Quips, and Cranks, and Wanton Wiles,
Nods, and Becks, and Wreathed Smiles&#8217; I used to
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>They left the snuggery, and, blissfully conscious
of her honors, Toinette presented her
father to the girls. Just how proud they were
of the marked attention he showed to each I&#8217;ll
leave it to some other girls to guess. He danced
with them, took them to supper, sought out
the greatest delicacies for them, and played
the gallant as though he were but twenty instead
of forty-two. &#8220;He treated us just as though
we were the big girls,&#8221; they said, when holding
forth upon the subject the next day.</p>
<p>Twelve o&#8217;clock came all too soon.</p>
<p>Mr. Reeve remained over night, and the following
day found an opportunity to have a long
talk with Miss Preston&mdash;a talk which afforded
him great satisfaction for many reasons.</p>
<p>Toinette, with several of the other girls, escorted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
him to the train, and gave him a most
enthusiastic &#8220;send-off.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the course of a few days a package was delivered
at the school. Had bomb-shells been
dropped there they could hardly have created
more excitement. Jean&#8217;s house was only a few
blocks from the school, and one Saturday morning&mdash;for
the cameras were obliging enough to
choose that day to appear&mdash;Mrs. Rockwood&#8217;s
sitting-room was the scene of the wildest excitement.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;WE&#8217;VE GOT &#8217;EM! WE&#8217;VE GOT &#8217;EM!&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Rockwood was in her sitting-room
one morning. It was Saturday,
and a day of liberty for Jean. She
had gone over to the school to spend a few hours
with Helen, and Mrs. Lockwood did not expect
her home until lunch-time, but, happening
to glance from her window about ten o&#8217;clock,
what was her surprise to see two figures approaching,
one with a series of bounds, prances and
jumps, which indicated a wildly hilarious and
satisfied frame of mind in Jean, and the other
with a subdued hop and skip, and then a sedate
walk, which, although less demonstrative, was
quite as indicative of a very deep and serene
happiness to any one familiar with Helen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>A moment later the front door slammed, and
two pairs of feet came tearing up the stairs as
though pursued by Boer cavalry, and two eager
voices cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got &#8217;em! We&#8217;ve got &#8217;em! We&#8217;ve
got &#8217;em!&#8221; and both girls came tearing into the
room to cast themselves and two very suggestive
looking parcels upon Mrs. Rockwood.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in this world has happened?&#8221; she
asked, in amazement, for both girls were breathless,
and could only point at the parcels in
her lap and say: &#8220;Open them! Open them,
quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rockwood was a woman who entered
heart and soul into her daughter&#8217;s pleasures,
and nothing was ever quite right in Jean&#8217;s eyes
unless her mother shared it. Every little plan
must be talked over with her, and it was pretty
sure not to suffer any from one of her suggestions.
Helen spent a great deal of time with
Jean and was devoted to Mrs. Rockwood. Consequently,
when the cameras arrived at the school
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
that morning, and they found out that there was
really no mistake, but that they were certainly
intended for the persons whose names were so
plainly written upon the boxes, and sent in Miss
Preston&#8217;s care, they could hardly wait to get over
to Jean&#8217;s house to show their treasures to her
mother. Many had been the surmises as to
whom had sent such beauties, but Toinette kept
a perfectly sober face, and no one suspected the
secret.</p>
<p>Carefully removing the wrappings, Mrs. Rockwood
brought the contents of the boxes to view.
She was as much surprised as the girls, and exclaimed:
&#8220;Why, who could have sent them to
you, and how did anyone learn that you were so
anxious to have them? Such beauties, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the funniest part of it all, for we
never told a soul, and didn&#8217;t mean to till we had
them, and now here they are. I believe St.
Nick must have heard us wishing for them,&#8221; said
Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to <i>both</i> of us, and just <i>alike</i>! Think of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
it! Oh, moddie, isn&#8217;t it lovely?&#8221; and Jean
threw her arms about her mother&#8217;s neck by way
of giving vent to her feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m as delighted as you and Helen are,
dear, only I wish we might learn who our benefactor
is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, isn&#8217;t it too bad. Well, it may crop out
later. I thought first it must be Miss Preston,
but she said that she did not know any more
about it than we did,&#8221; said Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, when may we take our pictures, and
what shall we take?&#8221; cried Jean.</p>
<p>&#8220;You suggest something, Mrs. Rockwood; it
will be nicer if you do it,&#8221; said Helen, dropping
down upon her knees beside Mrs. Rockwood,
and placing her arm around her friend&#8217;s waist.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rockwood drew her close to her side as
she replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me examine these treasures which have
arrived so mysteriously, read the directions concerning
them, and then we&#8217;ll see what we&#8217;ll
see,&#8221; and she began to read: &#8220;Take the camera
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
into a perfectly dark closet, where no ray of
light can penetrate (even covering the keyhole),
and then place within it one of the sensitive
plates, being careful not to expose the unused
plates. Your camera is now ready to take the
picture, etc.&#8221; &#8220;That is all very simple, I&#8217;m sure,
and if the taking proves as simple as are the
directions you need have little apprehension of
failure. But your directions add very explicitly
that you must <i>not</i> attempt to take a picture unless
the day is sunny. So I fear those conditions
preclude the possibility of your taking any
upon this cloudy day, and you will have to possess
your souls in peace till &#8216;Old Sol&#8217; favors you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, isn&#8217;t that too bad! I thought we
could take some right off. Don&#8217;t you think we
might at least try, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear they would prove failures; better wait
a more favorable light.&#8221;</p>
<p>As though to tantalize frail humanity, &#8220;Old
Sol&#8221; remained very exclusive all day, and, even
though Helen remained till evening in the hope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
that he would overcome his fit of sulks, nothing
of the kind happened, and she was forced to go
back to the school without one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait till Monday, and we&#8217;ll do wonders;
see if we don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Jean, as she bade her farewell,
little dreaming what wonders she was destined
to do with her magical box ere the sun set
Monday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask Miss Preston to let me come over
at four o&#8217;clock on Monday, and then we&#8217;ll go
out in the little dell and get a lovely picture.
You know the place I mean: where that old
clump of fir-trees stands by the ruined wall,&#8221; said
artistic Helen.</p>
<p>But when Monday arrived unforeseen difficulties
arose for Jean. The day was the sunniest
ever known, and, while waiting for Helen to
come, she got out the precious camera to set the
plates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, mamma, there isn&#8217;t a dark closet in
the whole house; not a single one,&#8221; cried Jean,
coming into her mother&#8217;s room as she was dressing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
to go out on Monday afternoon. &#8220;Now,
where in this world am I to open my plate-box,
I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rockwood laughed as she turned toward
Jean, whose face was the picture of dismay.
&#8220;True enough, there isn&#8217;t. Now, who would
have supposed that the architect who designed
this house, and put a window in every closet,
could have been so short-sighted as not to
anticipate such a need as the present one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what am I to do?&#8221; desperately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try putting a dark covering over the windows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have, but it&#8217;s just no use, for I can&#8217;t get it
pitch dark to save me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think that barely forty-eight hours
ago I was congratulating myself that every closet
in the house could be properly aired. Alas!
how do our recent acquisitions alter our views?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, moddie, don&#8217;t laugh, but stop teasing
me, and just think as hard as ever you can <i>how</i>
I am to find a dark place.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Rockwood thought for a few moments,
and then said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have it! Mary&#8217;s pot-closet, under the
back stairs; that is as dark as a pocket, I&#8217;m
sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There! I knew you&#8217;d find a way; you always
do. Just the very place, and now I&#8217;m
going straight down to fix it. Good-bye,&#8221; and,
kissing her mother, away she flew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>A CAMERA&#8217;S CAPERS.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Mary!&#8221; cried Jean, as she bounced into
the kitchen, where the maid, a typical
&#8220;child of Erin,&#8221; who worshipped
the very ground Jean trod upon, stood at the
sink paring her &#8220;taties&#8221; for the evening meal,
&#8220;see my new camera; I&#8217;m going to take a picture
with it, and I&#8217;ve got to go into your pot-closet
to fix the plates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A picter, is it? And will ye be afther takin&#8217;
a picter wid that schmall bit av a black box?
How do ye do it at all, I do&#8217; know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I go into a dark closet and put a gelatine
plate in the box, and then I go outdoors
and take my picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A gilitin plate, is it? Thin, faith, ye&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
take ne&#8217;er a picter this day, for Oi&#8217;m jist afther
usin&#8217; the last schrap av gilitin in the house to
make the wine jilly fer the dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean <i>that</i> kind of gelatine; the kind
I use is already prepared on little plates in this
box, and I have to go in the dark closet to fix
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, I&#8217;d fix thim out here, thin, where ye
can see what ye&#8217;re about. It&#8217;s dungeon dhark
in the pot-closet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is exactly what I want, and, <i>please</i>,
don&#8217;t come near it, or open the door while I&#8217;m
in there, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; I&#8217;ll not come near ye. The minute
I&#8217;ve done me taties it&#8217;s down in the laundry
Oi&#8217;m goin&#8217;, an&#8217; Oi&#8217;ll not bother ye at all; but
here, take this schmall, little candle wid ye
whan ye go in, fer it&#8217;s that dhark ye&#8217;ll not see
yer hand forninst ye,&#8221; and she caught up a
candle from the shelf.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! I don&#8217;t <i>want</i> any light; the darker
it is the better.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crackin&#8217; yer head aff ye&#8217;ll be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t,&#8221; said Jean, as she whisked
into the closet and drew the door together just
as Mary started down the back stairs to the
laundry.</p>
<p>Had the closet been designed for an eel-pot it
would have proved the most complete success,
for getting into it was a very simple matter,
whereas, getting <i>out</i> required considerable ingenuity.
Absorbed in the one idea of getting the
plates placed in the camera, Jean entirely forgot
the peculiarities of the fastening upon the
door. As she slammed it together every ray of
light vanished, and she was instantly enveloped
in an Egyptian darkness. Carefully opening
her box, she drew from it one of the plates,
touched it with her fingers to find which side
was coated with the gelatine preparation, placed
it in the camera and turned to leave the closet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll have a picture in just about two
jiffs,&#8221; she said, and pushed against the door.
To her surprise, it did not open. Another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
push, with the same result. It then dawned
upon her that the spring-bolt had fastened upon
the outer side. Feeling carefully about in the
pitch darkness, she laid her things upon the shelf
and tried to find a way of getting out. But,
push, shake and rattle as she might, it was useless;
the door remained tightly fastened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary,&#8221; she called, &#8220;come and let me out,
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>No response.</p>
<p>&#8220;M-a-r-y! I&#8217;m locked in; come let me out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the whorld is the matter wid ye?&#8221;
came from the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m locked <i>in</i> and can&#8217;t get out; come and
open the door!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Och, worra! Don&#8217;t be callin&#8217; to me not to
<i>open</i> the door; didn&#8217;t Oi tell ye Oi wouldn&#8217;t
come near ye, and Oi <i>won&#8217;t</i>. It&#8217;s goin&#8217; down
to the bharn Oi am, and ye needn&#8217;t be for worritin&#8217;,
at all, at all,&#8221; and receding footsteps proved
Mary&#8217;s words only too true.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m in a pretty fix, am I not? Like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
enough she won&#8217;t come back for twenty minutes,
and here I&#8217;ve got to stay. Plague take the old
bolt!&#8221;</p>
<p>What imp of mischief made Mary return to
the laundry by the cellar-door, take up her
basket of freshly laundered clothes, and, after
carrying them up to Mrs. Rockwood&#8217;s bedroom,
go on to her own in the third story to dress for
the afternoon, must forever remain a mystery.
But this she did, and, as Jean heard her go up
the back stairs, beneath which she was securely
fastened in the pot-closet, she thumped and
pounded with renewed energy. But the only
response was:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; not for the whorld, darlint, would
Oi disthurbe ye and spoil yer purty picter.&#8221;</p>
<p>About an hour later Mrs. Rockwood, returning
from her call, met Helen upon the front
piazza.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Jean got everything ready to take the
pictures?&#8221; she asked, eagerly. &#8220;It is such a
perfect day for it, and I am so anxious that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
can hardly wait. It seems too good to be true
that we have really got cameras at last, doesn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems as though the fairies must have
been aware of your great desire to have them,
and so took matters into their own hands,&#8221; replied
Mrs. Rockwood, as she unfastened the
front door with her latch-key and held it open
for Helen to enter.</p>
<p>As they entered the hall they were greeted
with a series of muffled thumps and bangs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>do</i> wish Mary would remember what I
have so often told her about breaking her kindling
upon the cellar floor,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Rattle, rattle! Bang, bang! and then a crash
as though the roof were falling.</p>
<p>&#8220;What under the sun can be the matter!&#8221;
exclaimed Mrs. Rockwood.</p>
<p>Just then Mary appeared at the head of the
stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mary, what is all this noise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shure, it was comin&#8217; down mesilf Oi was to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
see. Saints presarve us, can there be thieves
in the house, Oi do&#8217; know!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather noisy thieves, I should think. Where
is Miss Jean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out in the fields beyant, wid her bit av a
camela takin&#8217; her picter, Oi&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;. &#8217;Twas
there she said she&#8217;d be goin&#8217; afther she came
out of the pot-closet&mdash;saints have mercy! Could
she <i>git</i> out at all, at all?&#8221; and Mary tore down
the stairs, with Mrs. Rockwood and Helen close
at her heels. She reached the closet, flung open
the door, and beheld a spectacle. Seated on the
floor, in the midst of a scattered array of pots,
kettles and frying-pans, her box of plates upset,
her precious camera in her lap, and blissfully
unconscious that the slide was open, sat Jean,
a very picture of despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty man! And have ye been in here
all this toim, an&#8217; not to be smothered dead!&#8221;
cried Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I be anywhere <i>else</i>, I&#8217;d like to
know?&#8221; said Jean, indignantly. &#8220;I called and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
<i>called</i>, but I couldn&#8217;t get you to let me out,&#8221;
and, bouncing up, she scrabbled the plates back
into their box, then caught up the camera to
see if all was as it should be with that. As she
jumped up the slide closed, and, quite unaware
that it had ever been open, she announced to
her nearly convulsed audience:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m <i>out</i> at last, and now I hope I can
take a picture; come on, Helen,&#8221; little dreaming
that the treacherous sunlight, which flashed
through the hall window and straight into the
pot-closet, had already printed a most perfect
one on the plate.</p>
<p>A few moments later both she and Helen
were out in the fields back of the house, and
had snapped charming little scenes.</p>
<p>Bemoaning her unintentional trick, Mary
went back to her work, while Mrs. Rockwood
went up to her room to laugh heartily over the
mishap, never suspecting that the funniest part
would appear in the sequel.</p>
<p>A half hour later the girls came flying into
her room to say, excitedly:</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
<a name='linki_8' id='linki_8'></a>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 332px;'>
&#8220;AN&#8217; HAVE YE BEEN IN THERE ALL THIS TIME?&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken them! We&#8217;ve taken them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I know they will be just lovely, for the
sun shone right on the trees and the ruins.
How I wish we could develop them; don&#8217;t you,
Helen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;d like to know how, and, now that I
have the camera, I shall get a developing outfit
and learn; but let&#8217;s take these right over to
Charlton&#8217;s and have him develop them for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>They started for the village to leave the plates
to be developed, and waited with what patience
they could for the following day, when the photographer
promised to send them the proofs.</p>
<p>They came, and one at least was truly a
marvel.</p>
<p>In the foreground of Jean&#8217;s was a pretty
clump of fir-trees growing beside an old ruined
stone wall, under which nestled a bunch of dry
goldenrod. But the background! Did ever
the maddest artist&#8217;s brain conceive of such?
Clear and distinct, where sky should have been,
stood&mdash;a frying-pan!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>WHISPERS</h3>
</div>

<p>March, with its winds and storms, slipped
away as though glad to whisk such
trying days off the calendar, and, ere
the girls realized it, Easter vacation was upon
them, and capricious April was playing the
schoolgirl herself, with one day a smile and the
next a frown. But, like the schoolgirl, her
smiles were all the sunnier for the frowns.</p>
<p>It must indeed be a dull, prosy old heart
which cannot respond to the soft beauty of early
spring, and want to frisk and frolic for very
sympathy with all the new life springing into
existence all about it. And there were no dull
or prosy ones at Sunny Bank.</p>
<p>For some time the girls had known that this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
would be Miss Howard&#8217;s last year with them;
but now little whispers began to fly about, as
little whispers have a trick of doing, that Miss
Howard was about to enter another school, where
she would be pupil instead of teacher, and there
learn the sweetest lesson ever taught on this big
earth&mdash;a lesson which says, &#8220;Not mine and
thine, but ours, for ours is mine and thine;&#8221; and,
while they rejoiced in her happiness, they were
nearly inconsolable at the thought of losing her,
for she had filled a very beautiful place in their
lives&mdash;far more beautiful than they suspected.
It was always Miss Howard who entered into
all their little plans and pleasures, participated
in their joys, and sympathized with their sorrows.</p>
<p>She was little more than a girl herself, yet
possessed the strength of character sometimes
wanting in a much older person, and by it set
a beautiful example for her girls to follow.
And they followed it unconsciously to themselves
and to her, for never was there a more modest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
little body than Miss Howard, and had anyone
hinted that she was a mighty balance-wheel to
her fly-away girls, a source of encouragement to
her timid ones, an inspiration to her ambitious
ones, and an object of very sincere affection to
all, she would probably have been the most surprised
person in the school. Yet such was undoubtedly
the fact, and it would have been a very
wrong-headed girl, indeed, who was not ready
to yield to her influence.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I felt criss-cross with all the world, I believe
I&#8217;d have to smile back when Miss Howard
smiled at me,&#8221; said Toinette, shortly after she
became a pupil in the school. &#8220;Her eyes are
just as soft as the little Alderney bossie&#8217;s, and
her lips look sort of grieved if the girls look
cross.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so the whispers grew louder and louder
till just after the Easter holidays were over, and
then all who loved her best learned that early
in June wedding bells would ring and a very
bonny bride would step forth from Sunny Bank,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
with several bonny bridesmaids leading the way,
and one maid of honor to scatter the posies which
were to be symbolical, as all hoped, of her future
pathway through life.</p>
<p>And then arose the all-important question as
to whom Miss Howard would choose for that
great honor, and excitement ran high.</p>
<p>All the girls had a strong suspicion that it
would be Toinette, although, to do her justice,
Toinette herself did not suspect it. Still, Miss
Howard had taken a keen interest in the girl
ever since she entered the school, and felt
strongly drawn toward her, being quick to see
her good qualities, and to understand that the
undesirable ones were very largely the result of
unfortunate circumstances. So she had striven
in her sweet and gracious way to help Toinette
without words, and had been a strong support to
Miss Preston.</p>
<p>As the warm spring days made wood and field
to blossom, the girls spent a great deal of their
time out of doors. Sunny Bank&#8217;s grounds were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
very beautiful, and the adjacent field and woodland
very enticing at that season. Basket-ball
was a favorite source of amusement, and the lawn
devoted to it as soft and smooth as velvet. So
nearly every afternoon the team could be seen
bounding about like so many marionettes, and if
touseled hair and demoralized attire resulted,
what did it matter? Rosy cheeks and ravenous
appetites were excellent compensations.</p>
<p>It was the fifteenth of April, and Toinette&#8217;s
birthday. Many a climb had the expressman&#8217;s
horse taken up the long hill leading to Sunny
Bank that morning, for, if Toinette had but few
friends, she certainly had a very generous father,
who meant that she should have her full share
of birthday remembrances, and they kept coming
thick and fast all day. With each came a funny
note to say that he was sending still another
package because he did not want her to have all
her surprises in a lump; they would seem so
much more if coming in installments. So they
kept coming all day long, and by four o&#8217;clock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
her room looked like a fancy bazaar. Last of all
to arrive was a large box upon which was printed
in flaring scarlet letters: &#8220;Not to be opened till
it is ten A. M. in <i>Bombay</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The box stood in the hall when Miss Preston
passed through the hall to dinner, and, unless
suddenly stricken with ophthalmy, she could not
fail to see the flaring notice. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said,
softly, to herself, &#8220;you have a triple mission,
you inanimate bit of the carpenter&#8217;s skill: first,
to teach my girls a lesson in longitude and time,
second, to mutely ask my permission for a frolic
to-night, and, third, to suggest that when birthdays
arrive it would be a most auspicious time
for the &#8220;C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;C.&#8217;s&#8221; to hold their revels, and
that Diogenes&#8217; tub, if not himself, would be welcome,
so I had better act upon the hint and contribute
my share. Thank you, sir,&#8221; and, with a
funny little nod to the box, she went on to the
dining-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the joke, Miss Preston?&#8221; asked
Cicely, as Miss Preston took her seat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I&#8217;m going to spoil it by revealing
it so soon? No, indeed,&#8221; and she
laughed softly.</p>
<p>When dinner was ended the girls flocked
around the box and curiosity ran riot. &#8220;What
does that mean, Miss Preston? Do tell us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have other matters of such importance on
hand that I must deputize Miss Howard to unravel
the mystery for you,&#8221; she said, as she
slipped away to the upper hall where the telephone
was placed, and a moment later the girls
heard the bell jingle and a funny, one-sided conversation
followed. &#8220;Hello, Central! 1305. Is
this 1305? Send me the usual order. Yes,
four kinds. Eight. Well packed. Be prompt.&#8221;</p>
<p>The porter carried the big box to Toinette&#8217;s
room and removed the lid for her. Such an
array! I&#8217;m not going to attempt to tell about
it, but shall let every girl who has ever attended
a chum&#8217;s birthday feast mention the articles of
which that feast consisted, and then, after combining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
the entire list, they can form some idea
of the contents of Toinette&#8217;s box.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fly, Cicely, and hunt up every C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;C.,
and a dozen besides! We can never dispose of
such a cartload of stuff in a week if we don&#8217;t
have the entire school to help us,&#8221; cried Toinette,
as she lifted one thing after another from
the box.</p>
<p>There is a saying that &#8220;Ill news flies fast,&#8221;
but, in my humble opinion, it is as a stage-coach
beside the Empire State Express when compared
to the fleetness of good news. So it did not take
long to start this bit like an electric fluid
through the school, and what sort of &#8220;Free
Masonry&#8221; filled in details so successfully I know
not.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THIS TIME OF NIGHT?&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>It so happened that of the ten resident
teachers but three were at home that evening;
the others having joined a theatre
party going to town, and it would be midnight
before they returned.</p>
<p>Those at home were Miss Preston, Miss Howard,
and, unfortunately, Mrs. Stone. Of the first
two mentioned the girls felt small apprehension,
for they understood them pretty thoroughly, but
Mrs. Stone was an obstacle not so easily surmounted,
and it seemed to them that she was
never more ubiquitous.</p>
<p>At nine-thirty Miss Preston had bade all
good-night in an unusually solicitous manner,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
wishing each happy dreams. Miss Howard had
also retired to her room promptly at the stroke
of the clock, and everything worked most auspiciously
excepting the tucking away of Mother
Stone, and she positively refused to be tucked,
but kept prowling about like a lost spirit, till
Ruth said, in desperation: &#8220;If she doesn&#8217;t get
settled down pretty soon I&#8217;ll do something desperate;
see if I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>From room to room she went, popping her
head in at one to ask if there was anything she
could do for this girl, listening at the next door
for sounds of insomnia, creeping stealthily on
through the corridors to learn if any girl who
ought to be en route for Sleepy Town had by
chance missed her way.</p>
<p>She had made her way as far as the lower
end of the hall, where on one side the stairs
leading to the third story joined it, and on the
other a door opened into the bath-room, when a
rustle at the head of the stairs caused her to
glance quickly in that direction; but it was too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
dark for her to see anything at the top of them.
She paused to listen, and her sharp ears detected
the sound again. That was sufficient.
Up she flew and came plump upon Lou Cornwall,
who had not had time to fly. Lou was
stout and did not move quickly, and was fair prey
for Mrs. Stone, who was as thin as a match, and
managed to glide about like a wraith.</p>
<p>Lou was arrayed in her bath-robe, and had
her cap and mask in her hand. Quickly concealing
them behind her lest Mrs. Stone&#8217;s sharp
eyes should discover them even in the dark, she
stood stock still waiting developments. Mrs.
Stone stooped from her towering height of five
feet nine to peer into the face of the plump little
figure huddled in the corner. &#8220;How you startled
me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Why are you standing here
when everyone else is in bed, and what are you
doing up this time of night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to get up, Mrs. Stone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, may I enquire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to the bath-room.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then, why in the world don&#8217;t you <i>go</i> and not
stand huddled up here as though you were bent
on some mischief? It is no wonder that we suspect
you when you take such extraordinary
ways of doing perfectly simple things. Go on
at once, and, if you have been hesitating because
you are timid, I&#8217;ll wait here till you return,&#8221;
and down she planted herself upon the top step
to mount guard.</p>
<p>Groaning inwardly, away went Lou, muttering:
&#8220;If I don&#8217;t keep you perched there till
you nearly freeze, my name isn&#8217;t Lou Cornwall!&#8221;</p>
<p>And keep her she did, till Mrs. Stone had
another trouble added to her many, for she began
to fear that Lou had been taken ill, and
went to the bath-room door to speak to her.
Finding that she could not hold out any longer,
out she came, and, after receiving some very
emphatic admonitions from Mrs. Stone, crept
away to her room disgusted with herself, the
world at large, and Mrs. Stone in particular.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>Meantime, the other girls began to suspect
that Lou had fallen into ambush, and sent out a
scout to reconnoiter, and it was not many seconds
before the scout came scuttling back with the
alarming information that the enemy was close
at hand; in fact, that she was even now coming
upon them in force, for, when Mother Stone
found that Lou did not come from the bath-room
as promptly as she thought she should, all
her suspicions were instantly aroused, and she
was keen to make discoveries.</p>
<p>The girls had planned to meet in Toinette&#8217;s
room, and creep from there to the old laundry
as soon as all were assembled. About a dozen
were already there, but, when the scout returned
with such dire tidings, they decided that discretion
was the better part of valor, and all made
haste to get back to their rooms ere the enemy
appeared. But, alack-a-day! that enemy could
flit about in a surprisingly lively manner, and,
ere some of them had reached safety behind
their own doors, she came in view. To get to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
their rooms now was out of the question, so,
making a virtue of necessity, they all slipped
into a large closet used by the housemaids for
their brooms, etc.</p>
<p>Whether it was from a wholesome fear that
Miss Preston would be very apt to criticize a
too pronounced vigilance that Mrs. Stone refrained
from opening the girls&#8217; doors, but contented
herself with simply listening, I cannot
say, but if she heard no sound within she always
passed on and left them to their innocent (?) slumbers.
So on she went from one room to another,
but, luckily, the alarm had gone before, and at each
room darkness and profound silence prevailed.
Satisfied that &#8220;all was well,&#8221; she murmured something
about, &#8220;It is always well to be upon the
alert, for once the girls understand that someone
is sure to detect the first signs of mischief, they
are far less liable to carry it to excess,&#8221; she set
off for her own room. In passing by the housemaid&#8217;s
door she saw that it was not tightly
closed and locked, as was the custom at night,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
and, with a joyous chuckle at her own astuteness,
she pounced upon it, locked the door, and
withdrawing the key sailed triumphantly to her
room, where, serene in her sense of well-doing,
she fell as sound asleep as her nature permitted.</p>
<p>Meantime, how fared it with the mice in the
trap? When the key was turned in the door,
and they were made prisoners, nothing but the
pitch darkness which enveloped them as a garment
prevented each girl&#8217;s face from plainly
announcing to her neighbor: &#8220;Here is a pretty
kettle of fish!&#8221; There were five in the closet:
Ruth, Edith, Pauline, May and Marie. Luckily,
a resourceful party. When all sound from the
hall had ceased, Ruth gave just one howl, and
then jumped up and down three times as hard
as she could jump, by way of giving vent to
her state of mind. Fortunately, the door was
a heavy one and the sound did not reach Mother
Stone&#8217;s ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;You crazy thing!&#8221; exclaimed Edith, &#8220;next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
thing you know you will have her after us
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we do; we&#8217;ve got to get out somehow,
haven&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but she is the last one in the world we
want to let us out. What a fix! If the girls
only knew of it, they would come and let us
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could they when she has the key, I&#8217;d
like to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Edith groaned: &#8220;I never thought of that
plagued old key. Bother take her and it, too!
Why couldn&#8217;t she have gone to bed just as
everybody else did, and have minded her own
business, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was exactly what she thought she was
doing,&#8221; laughed May.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very well to laugh, but <i>how</i> are we
to get down to the laundry, I&#8217;d like to know;
or the girls ever find out where we are?&#8221;</p>
<p>While all this talking had been going on,
little Marie, the liveliest, slightest, most quick-witted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
girl in the school, had been doing a lot
of thinking, and now turned to the others and
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see that scrap of a window up
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we see it, but it might as well be a rat-hole,
for all the good it will do us; nothing but
a rat could crawl through it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure,&#8221; answered Marie, with a
knowing laugh. &#8220;I can get through a pretty
small space when occasion demands, and, if I&#8217;m
not much mistaken, the demand is very urgent
just at this moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How under the sun can you reach it, even
if you can get through it after you&#8217;ve reached
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What good have you derived from your
gymnastic training this winter, I&#8217;d like to
know, if you have to ask me that?&#8221; demanded
Marie.</p>
<p>The window was one of those odd little affairs
one sometimes sees built in houses, perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
simply to excite curiosity and make one wonder
why they were ever built at all, for they do not
seem to be of the slightest use. The one in
question was situated high up in the closet, and
had probably been put there for ventilating purposes,
if anyone ever felt inclined to get a step-ladder
and clamber up to open it. It was shaped
like a segment of a circle, was only about eighteen
inches high at the widest part, and fastened
at the top with a bolt. Getting at it in broad
daylight would not have been an easy matter,
and now, with only the light of the moon shining
through it, it seemed an impossibility.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;LOVE (AND SCHOOLGIRLS) LAUGH AT LOCKSMITHS&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Here, I&#8217;m going to take command of
affairs, since no one else seems inclined
to,&#8221; cried Marie. &#8220;May, you are the
strongest girl here; just give me a shoulder, will
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand close to the wall underneath the
window, and let me get on your shoulder; it
may hurt a bit, but we can&#8217;t stay stived up in
here all night. Lend a hand, Ruth, and boost
me up.&#8221;</p>
<p>A step-ladder of knees and arms was formed,
and up scrambled Marie as nimbly as a squirrel.
Then another obstacle confronted her. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
window had probably never been opened since
it was built, and, having never been called upon
to do its share in the economy of that household,
was disinclined to begin now. Marie&#8217;s
slender fingers were dented and pinched in vain;
that window remained obdurate.</p>
<p>&#8220;For mercy sake come down and give the
old thing up! My shoulder is crushed flat,&#8221;
said May.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait just one second longer, and I&#8217;ll have
it; see if I don&#8217;t. Ruth, hand me that stair-brush,
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ruth gave her the brush, and, saying to May:
&#8220;Now, brace yourself for a mighty push,&#8221; she
used the handle as a lever, gave a vigorous jerk,
when away went bolt, window, Marie and all.
Down she came with a thud, but, luckily, on a
pile of sweeping cloths, which saved her from
harm.</p>
<p>Scrabbling up, she cried: &#8220;Never mind, I&#8217;m
not hurt a bit; now boost me up again, and let
me see what is outside.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>She was promptly lifted up, and, poking her
saucy head out into the moonlight, drew in long
whiffs of the sweet night air, which was wonderfully
refreshing after the stuffy closet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The shed is about ten feet below, girls. If
I had anything to lower myself down with I
could easily reach it; I&#8217;m almost afraid to let
myself drop, the shed slopes so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang fast a second while Ruth and I tie
the sweeping-cloths together,&#8221; cried May, and
quickly catching up the calico covers they began
to tie them together.</p>
<p>&#8220;See that you tie them tightly,&#8221; warned
Marie. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had one bump already, and I
don&#8217;t want another.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cloths were soon ready, and one end
handed to her. She fastened it securely about
her waist, and, warning the others to hang on
for dear life, she began to crawl through the
narrow opening.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness, she is just like a monkey,&#8221; said
Pauline. &#8220;I never could have done it in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
world,&#8221; a most superfluous assertion, as no one
in the world would ever have suspected her of
being able to.</p>
<p>Away went Marie, vanishing bit by bit from
their sight till only her laughing black eyes,
with the soft dark hair above them, were visible
in the moonlight. The girls lowered away
slowly, and presently felt the strain upon the
cloths relax.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s on the shed! Good!&#8221; said Edith,
&#8220;and now she&#8217;ll have us out in less than jig
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>But &#8220;many&#8217;s the slip twixt the&mdash;lip and the
birthday box,&#8221; and the girls began to suspect
Marie of treachery to the cause ere they again
heard her voice.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 326px;'>
&#8220;AWAY WENT MARIE, VANISHING BIT BY BIT.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>Meantime, how fared it with her? Once upon
the shed all seemed plain sailing, but the shed
was somewhat like the mountains Moses climbed
so wearily; it gave her a glimpse of the promised
land without permitting her to enter it. The
ground was fully sixteen feet below her, and to
reach it without some means other than her own
nimble legs was obviously impossible. The shed
was only a small one built out over the kitchen,
but just beyond, with perhaps five feet dividing
them, was the end of the piazza roof, and if she
could only reach that she could let herself down
to the ground by the thick vines growing upon
it. But those five feet intervening looked a
perfect gulf, and how to get over them was a
poser. Jump it she dared not; step it she could
not. It began to look as though she must signal
to the girls in the closet to haul in their big
fish, when she chanced to spy something sticking
up through the honeysuckle vines. Crawling
carefully down to the edge of the shed,
she peered over, and saw the ends of the gardener&#8217;s
ladder. Pauline had not made a mistake
when she called her a monkey, for in
just one second she was at the bottom of that
ladder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m all right, and will soon have the
girls free,&#8221; and off she scurried to the side of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
the house upon which Toinette&#8217;s room was situated.
Gathering up a handful of soft earth
she threw it against the window, but with no result.
Then a second one followed. Had she
but known it, Toinette and her revellers had
long ago given them up, and were now down in
the old laundry spreading forth their array of
goodies. After wasting considerable time, Marie
suddenly bethought her of the above fact, and instantly
skipped off to that Mecca.</p>
<p>There was not a ray of light visible, but,
happily, sight is not the only sense with which
we are endowed, and Marie&#8217;s ears were as keen
as her eyes. Giving the three signal taps upon
one of the tightly closed window-blinds, she
waited a reply. But the girls were not expecting
taps from that quarter, and at once became
suspicious. But precious moments were fleeing,
and Marie was becoming desperate, so, flinging
prudence to the winds, she gave three sounding
bangs upon that window, and called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t open this window and let me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
in I&#8217;ll set Mother Stone on your track, sure as
you live!&#8221;</p>
<p>Open flew the window, and a moment later
Marie was relating her experiences to them.
Then came the question of rescuing the others.
Not an easy one to answer. But Marie had
gone so far, and, being a very resourceful little
body, had no notion of giving up yet, and saying
to the revellers: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to let those girls
out if I have to take the door down to do it,&#8221;
off she flitted, as quickly and silently as a butterfly.
In less time than it takes to tell it she
stood outside their prison, and saying, encouragingly:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t give up, girls; I&#8217;ll soon have you
out,&#8221; she slipped into the sewing-room opposite,
and emerged a second later with the little oil-can
and screw-driver from the machine drawer.</p>
<p>&#8220;For gracious sake, what <i>are</i> you going to
do?&#8221; whispered Cicely, who had come with her
to help if possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something I once saw a carpenter at our
house do, if I can. Sh! Don&#8217;t make any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
noise,&#8221; and, reaching up to the top hinge, Marie
dropped a few drops of oil from her can upon
it, and then treated the lower one in the same
manner. The hinges were what are known as
&#8220;fish hinges,&#8221; the door being held in place by
a small iron peg slipped into the sockets of the
hinge. After she had oiled them, she placed
her screw-driver under the knob of the peg,
when, lo! up it slid as easily as could be, and
when both had been carefully slid out of place,
nothing prevented the door from being softly
drawn away from the hinges, swung outward,
and if it did not open from left to right, as it
had been intended to open, it was quite as
easy to walk through it when it opened from
right to left. To slip it back into place, when
five giggling girls had escaped, was equally
easy, and no one would ever have suspected
the skillful bit of mechanical engineering that
had taken place under their very noses at ten-thirty
that night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>ARIADNE&#8217;S CLUE</h3>
</div>

<p>The manner in which those liberated girls
skipped down to the laundry was certainly
not snail-like. They had nearly
reached it when Ruth&#8217;s feet became entangled in
a piece of string, and, stooping down to loosen
it, she discovered a slip of paper fastened to the
end, and a large pin which had evidently stuck
it fast to the door-casing. No doubt some of
the girls had brushed against it in their hurry-scurry
to reach the laundry, and, but for the
ill wind which blew five of them into the housemaid&#8217;s
closet, this significant scrap of paper
would never have been discovered. The candle
they carried was brought to bear upon it, and
they read the following words:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>In ancient days, so the stories say,</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Lest a rule should break instead of bend.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;What can it mean? Where does it lead
to?&#8221; were the questions eagerly whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, and let&#8217;s find out,&#8221; was Ruth&#8217;s
practical remark, and she began to wind up the
string. There seemed no end to it, and it led
them through the corridor, out of that into the
kitchen, then out to a small store-room built beneath
the kitchen porch. Here the end was tied
to a very suggestive-looking tub.</p>
<p>Had Diogenes succeeded in discovering an
honest man he could not have felt greater satisfaction
than these girls felt at the sight of that
modest little oval tub, with its sawdust covering;
and the way in which it was pounced upon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
and borne in triumph to the laundry, brings my
story of that night&#8217;s revels to a climax, and no
more need be told.</p>
<p>When the twelve o&#8217;clock train whistled it was
the signal for the revels to end, and, ere the
carriages which were to meet the theatre-goers
could bring them up the hill, Sunny Bank was
as quiet and peaceful as though all its inmates
had been dreaming for hours.</p>
<p>The weather had become beautifully soft and
balmy for the middle of April, and the girls
were able to sit out of doors, and do many of
the things they had not hoped to do till May
should burgeon and bloom.</p>
<p>A few days after the frolic Toinette was sitting
in one of the pretty little summer-houses, of
which there were several dotted about the
grounds, when Miss Howard came in and took
her seat beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been playing at hide-and-seek
with me without knowing it,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for I
have been searching for you everywhere, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
only discovered you here by the glint of the sunshine
upon your hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you want me, Miss Howard? I&#8217;m sorry
you had to hunt for me,&#8221; answered Toinette.
&#8220;What can I do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me some wise advice,&#8221; said Miss Howard,
smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> give you advice!&#8221; exclaimed Toinette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; don&#8217;t you think you can?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to know what it is about before
I dare say yes or no, Miss Howard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that I am going to leave you in
a few weeks, dear, and I want my leave-taking
to be closely identified with my girls, whom I
have learned to love so dearly, and whom, I
think, love me as well as I love them. I have
spent many happy years in this school, first as
pupil and then as teacher, and it has been a very
dear home to me. Now I am going away from
it forever, and though the future looks very
enticing, and I have every reason to believe
that it will be happy, still I cannot help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
feeling sad at the thought of leaving the old
life behind. These are serious confidences for
me to burden you with, Toinette, but you have
crept into a very warm corner of my heart since
you became a pupil here, and I know that there
is a wise little head upon these shoulders,&#8221; said
Miss Howard, as she placed her hand on Toinette&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>The girl reached up, and drawing the hand
close to her cheek held it there, but did not speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;So now,&#8221; continued Miss Howard, &#8220;I am
going to ask you to help my outgoing from this
happy home to be a pleasant one, by being my
maid of honor when the time comes; will you,
dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want <i>me</i> to be the maid of honor, Miss
Howard? You don&#8217;t truly mean it? There
are so many other girls whom you have known
so much longer, and whom you must love better
than you do me; although I don&#8217;t believe they
<i>can</i> love <i>you</i> any better than I do,&#8221; said Toinette,
naively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is just it, dear. I do love them all, and
am sure that they are very fond of me. But
in your case it is just a little different. All
these girls have pleasant homes, and many loved
ones in them who plan for their happiness, and
to whom they will go directly vacation begins.
For many years you, like myself, have had
no home but the one a school offered, and which,
unlike mine, was sometimes not as happy a home
as it might have been, I fear. So, you see, we
have, in one way, had a bond of sympathy between
us even before we knew it to be so. And
now we have still another, for when we leave
here in June we shall each go to our own dear
home; you to one your father shall make for
you, I to the one my husband will provide for
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A soft, pretty color had crept over Miss Howard&#8217;s
face as she spoke, and a very tender look
came into her beautiful eyes. Truly, she was
carrying something very sweet and holy to the
one who was to bear that name.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So we shall step out into the new life together,
shall we not, Toinette, and each will be
the sweeter for our having done so?&#8221; asked
Miss Howard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too lovely even to think about, Miss
Howard. I don&#8217;t know how to make you understand
how proud and happy it makes me to
think that you chose me from among all the
others, and I hope they will not feel that you
should not have done so. Do you think they
will mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, they are delighted with
my choice, for I told them my reasons, as I have
told them to you, and they see it in the same
light that I see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall be the happiest girl in Montcliff,&#8221;
cried Toinette.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, <i>next</i> to the happiest,&#8221; said Miss Howard,
laughing softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I shall be the happiest in <i>my</i> way,
and you in <i>yours</i>,&#8221; and Toinette wagged her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
head as though it would be of no use for Miss
Howard to try to make her concede <i>that</i> point.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now let us plan our maid of honor&#8217;s
toilet, and also what our six bridesmaids must
wear. It was upon that important question I
wished your advice, and, now that you know, do
you feel qualified to give it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how lovely!&#8221; cried Toinette. &#8220;Why,
Miss Howard, it is almost like planning for my
own wedding, and you are too sweet for anything
to let me.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;WHEN BUDS AND BLOSSOMS BURST&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The planning of the toilets took considerable
time, and Miss Howard felt that
she had made no mistake when she asked
the girl&#8217;s advice. Like her father&#8217;s, Toinette&#8217;s
taste was unerring, and when she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be pretty to have the girls
represent flowers?&#8221; Miss Howard was delighted
with the idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;What flowers would you suggest, dear?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me think just a moment, please,&#8221; said
Toinette, and she rested her chin upon her hands,
a favorite attitude of hers when thinking seriously
of anything. &#8220;How would a lily, a violet, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
pansy, a daffodil, a narcissus, and a snowdrop
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How pretty!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Howard.
&#8220;What put such a picturesque idea in your
head? It is beautiful, and can be carried out
admirably. You must be my fair and lovely
lily; then shall come my violet and daffodil;
then my narcissus and lilac; then my pansy and
modest little snowdrop. That will exactly suit
Helen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are to be the bridesmaids?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Edith, May, Ruth, Marie, Natala and
Helen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How nice of you to choose all the younger
girls; it makes us feel so important. Now, let&#8217;s
plan just what the dresses are to be,&#8221; said
Toinette, becoming quite excited, and looking at
Miss Howard as though all must be completed
ere they left the summer-house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am waiting for your suggestions,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be pretty to have all the dresses
made of white chiffon, or something soft like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
that, and have white, violet and yellow slips
under them? Then have the hats trimmed with
the flowers they represent. Would you like
that, Miss Howard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, immensely; but now I want to think
about Helen. You know she has very limited
means, and what might seem a small outlay for
the others would probably be a large one for her,
and I do not want to tax her resources, much
as I wish to have her for one of my bonny
maids.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Toinette, meditatively, &#8220;I suppose
the dresses will be rather expensive, but it
would be too bad not to have Helen; she is so
sweet and is so fond of you, Miss Howard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she is a dear child, and I have felt a
great interest in her from the moment she entered
the school. I wish I knew of some way
of bettering her circumstances. Mr. Burgess is
a most estimable man, but not one liable to advance
rapidly through his own efforts, I fear.
He is most reliable and capable, but seems to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
lack the push so essential in this bustling day
and age. He would prove invaluable in any
position of trust, but would never secure such if
it depended upon his own efforts to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toinette had listened very attentively while
Miss Howard was talking, and when she finished
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;When papa was out here for the dance I
spoke to him about Helen, and we had such a
nice little talk. The next day he spoke with
Miss Preston about those very things, but I do
not know what came of it. I wish I did. His
business affairs bring him into contact with so
many large firms of different kinds that I am
almost sure he could secure something for Mr.
Burgess. Do you know what I am going to
do?&#8221; said Toinette, eagerly, &#8220;I am going to
write to him right off, tell him all about our
plans; may I? About the wedding, the bridesmaids,
and everything; then I am going to
ask him if he has heard of anything that he
thinks would help Mr. Burgess, and, who knows,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
maybe, by the first of June all will be fixed up
so nicely that Helen can have things as nice
as the other girls&mdash;and, oh, Miss Howard!&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
it be <i>lovely</i> if she could go abroad with
Miss Preston?&#8221; and Toinette clasped her hands
in rapture at the very thought.</p>
<p>Miss Howard laughed a happy little laugh,
and, taking Toinette&#8217;s face in both her hands,
kissed her cheeks very tenderly, saying as she
did so:</p>
<p>&#8220;I see that I made no mistake in my estimate
of your character, dear, although I did not bargain
for quite such a wise, resourceful little
head and efficient helper as you have proved.
How did you manage to think out so much in
so short a time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is because my brains have never
been overburdened with thoughts for other people,&#8221;
said Toinette, with an odd expression overspreading
her face, &#8220;and so the part of them
devoted to that sort of thing has had time to develop
to an astonishing degree. But I guess I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
better begin to use the power before it becomes
abnormal; Miss Preston says that abnormal
development of any sort is dangerous,&#8221; and she
gave a funny little laugh as she glanced slyly
into Miss Howard&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Miss Howard understood the quaint remark,
and, rising from her seat, said: &#8220;I shall not soon
forget our little talk, but must leave you now for
the &#8216;school ma&#8217;am&#8217;s&#8217; duties. One of them will
be to endeavor to persuade Pauline that it was
<i>not</i> Henry VIII. who sought to reduce the
American Colonies to submission, nor Lafayette
who won the battle of Waterloo. Good-bye,&#8221;
and away tripped Miss Howard over the soft
green lawn.</p>
<p>Toinette sat for a few moments, and then,
springing up, said to herself: &#8220;I might as well
go and write that letter this very minute, and I
do hope papa will know of something right off.
How lovely it would be!&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter was soon written, and within two
hours was speeding upon its way to New York.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
Toinette had reasoned well, and, as good luck
would have it, the letter arrived at a most auspicious
moment. As Mr. Reeve sat reading it,
his face reflecting the happiness he felt at receiving
it so close upon the one which came to
him every Monday morning, a client was shown
into his office.</p>
<p>It happened to be one who was about to embark
upon a new line of business in which he
was venturing large sums of money, and which
required capable, trustworthy men to carry out
his plans. He had consulted with Mr. Reeve
many times before, and nearly all details were
completed; the few that remained dealt with
minor matters, so Mr. Reeve felt considerable
satisfaction at the thought of having brought all
arrangements through so successfully. But it
was certainly anything but a contented face he
saw before him when he glanced up from Toinette&#8217;s
letter upon Mr. Fowler&#8217;s entrance, and
his first words were: &#8220;Well, for a prosperous
capitalist, you bear a woeful countenance, Ned.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If mine is woeful, yours certainly is not,&#8221;
was the prompt answer. &#8220;You look as though
you had been the recipient of some very pleasing
news.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty good sort,&#8221; said Mr. Reeve, smiling.
&#8220;The sort that makes a man feel old and
young at the same time. Ever get any of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know as I do; it must be a rare specimen,&#8221;
said Mr. Fowler, dryly. &#8220;Better let me
know the kind it is; perhaps it will counterbalance
the kind I have for you this morning;
confound it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing that Mr. Fowler was really disturbed
about something, Mr. Reeve dropped his bantering
tone, and went to serious matters. He then
learned that the bookkeeper whom Mr. Fowler
had engaged for the new line of business, and
who would also act as his confidential clerk and
office manager, would be unable to accept the
position, as he was called to England by the
death of his father, and would in future make
his home there. This was a serious loss to Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
Fowler, for he had known this man for years,
and felt deep satisfaction at the thought of having
such an efficient assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he said, when he had told Mr.
Reeve all the facts, &#8220;who under heavens am I
to find to fill his place at such short notice, I&#8217;d
like to know? Such men are not to be picked
up at every corner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Read that letter,&#8221; was all Mr. Reeve said,
and handed him Toinette&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p>Mr. Fowler took the letter, and began reading
with a very mystified expression, as though he
could not for the life of him understand what a
letter from Mr. Reeve&#8217;s daughter had to do with
his private affairs. But, as he read, his expression
changed, and when he came to the end he said:
&#8220;Well, it may be Kismet; can&#8217;t say. Funnier
things have happened. Look into it, will you,
Clayton? I&#8217;m sick and tired of the thing,
particularly when I thought all important details
settled.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Clayton Reeve did &#8220;look into it&#8221; very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
thoroughly, leaving no stone unturned which
would help him to learn all that it was necessary
to know about Mr. Burgess, and nothing could
possibly have been more gratifying than what
he learned. As a result of it, Mr. Burgess was
offered the position from June first, and the
salary offered with it seemed a princely one to
him as compared to the one he had received as
clerk in the bank in Montcliff. It would be
hard to understand the happiness which that
schoolgirl letter brought to one family, or how
the writing of it changed two lives very materially,
and a third completely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>COMMENCEMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>Many a girl has asked: &#8220;Why do they
call it commencement when it is really
the end?&#8221; If they have not found out
why, I am not going to tell the secret. But one
thing I have found out is this: Never in after
life do we ever feel <i>quite</i> so important as we do
when that day has been reached upon our life&#8217;s
calendar.</p>
<p>It was no exception at Sunny Bank, and when
the fifth of June dawned that year it found a
busy, bustling household. No, I am not telling
the exact truth: it was not when it <i>dawned</i>, but
fully three hours later, and then began the hurry-scurry
which continued till all were assembled
in chapel to listen to the opening prayer of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
good man who had for many a year opened the
Sunny Bank commencement exercises.</p>
<p>He had grown old in faithful service in Montcliff,
and was beloved and revered by all.</p>
<p>It is of no use for me to tell you all about
those exercises; to an outsider they were exactly
like many others that had taken place before;
to the girls themselves they were unique, and
stood out pre-eminent above all others. Everybody
was there who had the smallest excuse for
being, and just how happy six bodies were I
will leave you to learn from what follows.</p>
<p>The exercises were to take place in the evening,
and all day long relatives and friends of the
girls arrived thick and fast. Among the first
was Toinette&#8217;s father. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t wait till evening,
you see,&#8221; he cried, as he met Toinette at
the railway station. &#8220;Yes, it is all settled; I
got them by a lucky chance at the very last
moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you say anything to Mr. Burgess about
it?&#8221; asked Toinette.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have not seen him; daresay he has
had his hands full since the first. We&#8217;ll speak
to Miss Preston first, and then call at the Burgess&#8217;
and tell them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How perfectly splendid! Oh, daddy, you
are a perfect wonder! How do you ever manage
to fetch things about so successfully?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I have found a wonderful incentive
to spur me on,&#8221; he answered as he handed her
into the carriage which was waiting for them,
and they whirled off up the hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will stay here till after the wedding,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked Toinette, snuggling
close to his side and slipping her arm through
his.</p>
<p>&#8220;What! Five whole days? What will you
do with me all that time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No danger of your suffering from ennui, I
guess,&#8221; laughed Toinette. &#8220;I will guarantee to
keep you occupied. And then, daddy, after all
is over we&#8217;ll go off together, and won&#8217;t we have
glorious times!&#8221; and she gave a rapturous little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
bounce at the thought of the delightful days to
come.</p>
<p>Miss Preston was to sail for Europe on the
fifteenth of June, five days after Miss Howard&#8217;s
wedding, and six girls were to go with her.
When it became an understood thing that Mr.
Burgess&#8217; financial affairs were to be so improved,
the possibility of Helen making one of the party
was talked over, although Mrs. Burgess was filled
with dismay at the thought of having her
daughter take such a step upon such short notice;
it seemed a tremendous thing to that quiet,
home-staying body. Still, Miss Preston had
long been anxious to have Helen go with her,
and, now that there seemed no further obstacle
to her doing so, could not make up her mind to
go without her.</p>
<p>She had talked it over with both Mr. and
Mrs. Burgess, but, it must be confessed, had met
with only lukewarm enthusiasm. Furthermore,
it was very late in the day to secure stateroom
accommodation upon the steamer by which Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
Preston would sail, her own and the girls having
been engaged for weeks.</p>
<p>Helen herself said very little, but Miss Preston
knew that the girl&#8217;s heart had long been set
upon going, and this year the route planned
took in the very points she had most wished to
visit, and which would prove the most profitable
for her to visit. In desperation, Miss Preston
turned to Mr. Reeve once more, for she had
found him a most resourceful man, and one not
likely to be easily baffled.</p>
<p>The result was that he had succeeded in making
a mutually agreeable exchange of staterooms
with some other people, and was now primed
and ready to carry the war into the enemy&#8217;s
country.</p>
<p>Soon after luncheon they all drove to Stonybrook,
a town about ten miles from Montcliff,
and Helen&#8217;s home. Evidently their persuasive
powers were strong, for ere the visit ended it was
decided that Helen should make one of Miss
Preston&#8217;s party to sail with her &#8220;over the ocean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
blue,&#8221; and some very happy people drove back
to Montcliff that afternoon.</p>
<p>The house seemed very quiet after the girls&#8217;
departure for their homes on the day following
commencement, for, excepting those who lived
too far away to return for the wedding, and
would remain as Miss Preston&#8217;s guests until after
the tenth, all had left that morning, and when
a house has been filled with twenty-five or thirty
girls, and all but eight or ten suddenly depart
from it, the quiet which ensues cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p>Mr. Reeve gave himself up to the enjoyment
of his five days&#8217; vacation as only a busy man
can, and when I add that he was a very happy
man, too, I need say no more.</p>
<p>The year had been one of many experiences
both for him and for Toinette, and for both was
ending far more happily than he had hoped it
would. The future seemed to promise a great
deal to them both, for they were growing to understand
each other better every day, and Toinette
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
was developing into a very lovely, as well as
a very lovable, companion. They had planned
a delightful summer vacation, to be spent in
travelling leisurely from place to place, as the
fancy took them, and Toinette had suggested
nearly all.</p>
<p>The five days at Montcliff were spent in driving
about the beautiful country, playing tennis,
rambling about the pretty woods, and doing an
endless number of delightful nothings, as people
can sometimes do when they fully make up their
minds to put aside the cares of the world for a
time.</p>
<p>They soon came to an end, and then came Miss
Howard&#8217;s wedding day.</p>
<p>There has always seemed something inexpressibly
sweet in Longfellow&#8217;s words in reference
to the forming of new ties and establishing
the new home. In Miss Howard&#8217;s case it was
to be a home filled with all the sweetest hopes
that can come into a woman&#8217;s life: hopes sanctified
by love and founded upon respect. Could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
they have a firmer foundation? The future
held great promise for her, although worldly-minded
folk might say that the step she was
about to take was not marked off by a <i>golden</i>
mile-stone, nor the path she would follow be
paved with a golden pavement. She knew that
quite well, and had wisely decided that a noble
character and a brilliant mind were excellent
substitutes, however agreeable it may be to have
the former, and, also, that the former minus the
latter are fairy gold.</p>

<p>As though all that was loveliest had united
to do her honor, and make the boundary-line
between the old and the new life
one to be long remembered by all who stood beside
her at it, the day set for Miss Howard&#8217;s
wedding was all that Lowell has written about it.
It was as &#8220;rare&#8221; and &#8220;perfect&#8221; as dear Mother
Nature could make it for one of her loveliest
children.</p>
<p>The girls had dressed the church, until it
seemed a very bower of bloom, and at every turn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
Miss Howard would find the posies of which she
was so fond. The three colors, if white may be
called a color, chosen for the bridesmaids&#8217; dresses
were used in the decorations, and altar, chancel,
transept and aisles were brilliant with daffodils,
narcissuses and lilacs, which filled the church
with their perfume.</p>
<p>The wedding was to take place at four o&#8217;clock,
and when that hour arrived little space was left
in the church for the tardy ones.</p>
<p>Nearly all the girls had returned for the ceremony,
and a bonnier lot it would have been difficult
to find than that which filled the front pews
of the church, for Miss Howard would have
them all near her, insisting that none of the
other guests could possibly have the same loving
thoughts for her that her girls would have.</p>
<p>Promptly at the stroke of four the great organ
rolled out its message to all, and, after her few
distant relatives had been conducted to their
seats, Miss Howard&#8217;s bonny bridesmaids appeared,
following another fancy of hers by walking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
together, with the ushers leading. First
came Edith and Marie; Edith&#8217;s yellow golden hair
a perfect background for the big white chip hat,
with its masses of violets, and her fair, soft skin
made softer and fairer by the fairy-like chiffon
draped so artistically over the pale violet satin
beneath it. A daintily gilded basket filled with
violets told all the story.</p>
<p>Saucy and pert beside her walked the little
brownie Marie, looking for all the world like
the bobbing daffies in her white basket. One
wanted to sing the old nursery rhyme: &#8220;Daffy-down-dilly
has come to town,&#8221; for they were
nodding a friendly greeting from her hat, and
seemed to lend their golden sheen to the satin
beneath the white chiffon gown.</p>
<p>Behind them followed May Foster and Natala
King. May&#8217;s bronze-brown hair and brilliant
coloring were a perfect foil for the creamy-white
narcissus blossoms on her hat and the creamy-white
of her gown. While Natala&#8217;s light-brown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
hair and hazel eyes needed just the lilac tints to
show how pretty they were.</p>
<p>Then came Ruth and Helen. Could Miss
Howard have chosen two who, placed beside
each other, would have formed a more pronounced
contrast? Not even the solemnity of
the occasion could overcome Ruth&#8217;s ruling passion,
curiosity: she was determined to see all to
be seen if it rested with her to do so. Nor were
the pert pansy blossoms upon her hat, nodding
a welcome to all, more on the alert. Or
could those which peeped from the folds of her
pansy-yellow gown, with its white chiffon draperies,
smile in a more friendly manner than
did Ruth, as she walked slowly up that aisle,
with shy, modest Helen at her side. Helen
looked the snowdrop to perfection, for if the
pansies needed Ruth&#8217;s gypsy coloring for a foil,
the snowdrops needed Helen&#8217;s pale blonde daintiness
for theirs. The only color which relieved
its pure white was the deep green of the wax-like
leaves, and the contrast was perfect. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
dress was of that soft silvery white only to be
contrived by the combination of satin and chiffon,
and Helen looked very lovely.</p>
<p>Behind them, a dream of fairness, walked
Toinette. Through the chiffon of her gown ran
fine golden threads, which caused it to glint and
glisten as the sunbeams. The white satin underneath
was of that peculiar ivory tint which combines
so exquisitely with gold tints. Her hat
was made of the chiffon, and trimmed with
Easter lilies, which nestled in its soft folds and
against the beautiful golden hair beneath them.
Her basket was also white, and she was a fitting
emblem of the pure soul she was leading to
the altar.</p>
<p>Then came the bride, her hand resting lightly
upon the arm of the friend who had led her
along the greater part of her life&#8217;s pathway, for
Miss Preston had been Miss Howard&#8217;s &#8220;guide,
philosopher and friend&#8221; almost as long as she
could remember. Very stately did she look, as
she walked up that aisle to give away at the altar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
something which the years had rendered very
precious to her, for sometimes &#8220;old maids&#8217; children&#8221;
are more dear to them than are the children
who claim the love of parents.</p>
<p>Miss Preston was very proud of her honors.</p>
<p>But no words can describe the girl who walked
at her side, her beautiful face made transcendently
so by the tenderest, holiest thought that
can fill a woman&#8217;s heart: that she is about to
become the wife of the man she loves. She
seemed to forget the church and all who were
gathered there to witness her happiness, and the
soft, dark eyes looked straight before her to the
altar, where her husband to be awaited her, as
though that altar was to her as the entrance to
the holy of holies; as, indeed, it was.</p>
<p>How brief is a marriage ceremony! A few
words are spoken and two lives are changed forever,
never again to be the same as they were
less than ten minutes before, but filled with new
duties, new obligations, and the responsibilities
we must all assume when we utter the words:
&#8220;I will.&#8221; God meant that it should be so, and
it is one of this world&#8217;s many blessings.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>The reception Miss Preston gave for her
&#8220;adopted daughter,&#8221; as she called Miss Howard,
now Mrs. Chichester, was long talked over by
the school, and quoted by the girls as &#8220;our reception&#8221;
for months.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Chichester sailed for Europe on
the same steamer which carried Miss Preston
and her girls, and a happier, merrier party it
would have been hard to find. Toinette and
Mr. Reeve went to bid them farewell and a
pleasant voyage, and the last faces those upon the
great ship saw as they swung out into the stream
were Toinette&#8217;s and her father&#8217;s.</p>
<p>And now we, too, must leave them&mdash;leave
them to the happy summer vacation, when they
learned how dear they were to each other, and
what a dear old world this is, after all, when two
people manage to look at it through little Dan
Cupid&#8217;s spectacles.</p>
